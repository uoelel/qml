## Inference

![](/img/inference.png){fig-align="center"}

## Bilingual advantage: myth or reality?

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
"**Bilingual advantage**" refers to the hypothesis that bilinguals possess a cognitive advantage over monolinguals due to greater cognitive control implied in using more than one language [@poarch2019; @samuel2018].

-   However, research has argued both for and against the existence of the bilingual advantage.

-   We can say research has been "inconclusive" [@franck2024; @garraffa2023].

## Inconclusive!

Note that inconclusive does not mean "there is no bilingual advantage". It means we do not know.

### Group activity

-   Discuss reasons for which research on the bilingual advantage is inconclusive.

-   You'll share what you discussed in a Wooclap poll in the next slide.

## Uncertainty and variability

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   **Uncertainty** is a characteristic of each observation of a phenomenon, due to measurement error or because we cannot directly measure what we want to measure.
-   **Variability** is found among different observations of the same phenomenon, due to natural fluctuations and measurement error.

### Group activity

-   Each group will get a research card with a short literature review and a small data set.

-   Answer the following question:

    > Are younger infants better at discriminating non-native phonetic contrasts than older infants?

## Many analysts, one data set

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   You just experienced a form of "many analysts, one data set" scenario.

-   @coretta2023 asked 30 teams to answer the same research question with the same data.

    > Do speakers acoustically modify utterances to signal atypical word combinations?

    -   Participants had to instruct a confederate to move a cube on top of an object. The object either had a typical or atypical colour: YELLOW vs BLUE banana.

-   We gave the data to all teams and they sent us back:

    -   **109 individual analyses**â€”a bit more than 3 analyses per team!
    -   **Nine teams out of the thirty (30%) reported to have found at least one statistically reliable effect.**
