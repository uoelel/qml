## Inference

![](/img/inference.png){fig-align="center"}

## Bilingual advantage: myth or reality?

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
"**Bilingual advantage**" refers to the hypothesis that bilinguals possess a cognitive advantage over monolinguals due to greater cognitive control implied in using more than one language [@poarch2019; @samuel2018].

-   However, research has indicated both a presence of the bilingual advantage and its absence.

-   Research is "inconclusive" [@franck2024; @garraffa2023].

### Group activity

-   Discuss reasons for which research on the bilingual advantage is inconclusive.

-   You'll share what you discussed in a Wooclap poll in the next slide.

## Uncertainty and variability

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

-   **Uncertainty** is a characteristic of each observation of a phenomenon, due to measurement error or because we cannot directly measure what we want to measure.
-   **Variability** is found among different observations of the same phenomenon, due to natural fluctuations and measurement error.
