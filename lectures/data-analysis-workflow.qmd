## Research process cycle: Overview

![](/img/res-process-cycle.png){fig-align="center"}

## Research questions and hypothesis

::: box-note
-   Research **questions** are testable questions.

-   Research **hypotheses** are falsifiable statements.

-   Check again [this entry](../posts/research-qh.qmd).
:::

. . .

::: box-tip
Two case studies:

-   **Descriptive and exploratory**: Do British infants use a different number of gestures depending on their cultural background?

-   **Explanatory and corroboratory**: vowel duration and gesture distance.
:::

## British infants' gestures: Study design

::: box-note
-   Published paper: <https://www.doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13406>

-   Three cultural backgrounds: English, Bangladeshi and Cantonese.

-   At least 20 infants per background.

-   Laboratory setting, three tasks.
:::

. . .

::: box-note
**Analysis plan** (gesture count by background)

-   Summaries with median and range.

-   Visualisation with strip charts.

-   Regression models

    -   Outcome variable: gesture count â†’ [Poisson family](../posts/regression-poisson.qmd).

    -   Predictors: cultural background.

## British infants' gestures: Interpretation

::: box-tip
-   The 80% CrIs of the predicted number of gestures are:

    -   Bengali: 36--40.

    -   Chinese: 35--38.

    -   English: 28--31.

-   English infants performed a lower number of gestures (5 to 11 gestures less than Chinese and Bengali infants at 80% confidence).

-   Chinese and Bengali children have very similar predicted numbers of gestures. Their difference is between -3.5 to +1.5 gestures at 80% confidence.
:::

## British infants' gestures: Reporting

> We fitted a Bayesian regression model to the number of gestures produced by each infant, using a Poisson distribution. As the only predictor, we included cultural background (Bengali, Chinese, English). This predictor was coded using indexing (by suppressing the intercept with `0 +` in the model formula).
>
> Based on the model and data, the number of gestures by cultural background are 36--40 for Bengali infants, 35--38 for Chinese infants, and 28-31 for English infants, at 80% confidence. When comparing each cultural background, there is an 80% probability that the difference in gesture number is between -3.5 and 1.5 for Bengali vs Chinese, -11 and -6 for English vs Bengali, and -10 and -5 for English vs Chinese.

## British infants' gestures: Research question

::: box-tip
Do British infants use a different number of gestures depending on their cultural background?
:::

. . .

::: box-note
Based on the model and data, while Bengali and Chinese infants have a very similar number of gestures, English infants have a somewhat lower count relative to the other two groups.
:::

## In the next lecture...

::: box-tip
Does the distance the tongue has to travel to produce a vowel determines the duration of the vowel?
