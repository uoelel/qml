## Cross-modality

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   There are links between the auditory and visual modalities.

-   A lot of research this concept, in fact originated with @kohler1929 who used "takete" and "maluma" (not the singer).

-   @koppensteiner2016 ask if not only shape, but also motion patterns enter in the cross-modality link.

@koppensteiner2016

-   46 students (24 females and 22 males; age M = 25.1 years, SD = 3.6) of the University of Vienna.

-   They saw a word (takete or maluma) and two stick-figures moving.

-   They had to pick the stick figure they thought was described by the word.

## The data

```{r}
#| label: kopper
#| message: false
#| echo: true

kopper <- read_delim("data/koppensteiner2016/takete_maluma.txt")
kopper
```

## Accuracy

```{r}
#| label: fig-kopper-acc
#| fig-cap: "Accuracy by stimulus type."

kopper |> 
  ggplot(aes(Tak_Mal_Stim, fill = Answer)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    x = "Stimulus type", y = "Proportion"
  )
```

## Modelling accuracy

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   We want to model the proportion of correct responses by stimulus type: both types should elicit the same level of accuracy.

-   We can use a Bernoulli regression model.

. . .

```{r}
#| label: kop-mutate
#| echo: true

kopper <- kopper |> 
  mutate(
    Answer_f = factor(Answer, levels = c("WRONG", "CORRECT"))
  )
levels(kopper$Answer_f)
```

## Accuracy: Bernoulli regression

```{r}
#| label: kop-bm
#| echo: true

kop_bm <- brm(
  Answer_f ~ Tak_Mal_Stim,
  data = kopper,
  family = bernoulli,
  cores = 4,
  seed = 9128,
  file = "cache/kop_bm"
)
```

## Accuracy: model summary

```{r}
#| label: kop-bm-summ
#| echo: true

summary(kop_bm)

```
