## Group activity

-   Form groups of 5/6 students. I will give you a card with a research topic.

-   Think about the following research components in relation to the research topic and come up with a "research plan":

    -   **Research process**: What are the steps?

    -   **Project management**: How would you manage roles, timeline, data storage?

    -   **Digital skills**: Which tools will you need?

    -   **Philosophy**: What count as evidence? What are your assumptions?

    -   **Ethics**: How would you ensure personal rights are respected?

## Group activity

-   Pick a group next to you and tell each other about your research plans.

-   What are the similarities and why do you think they are what they are?

-   How do your plans differ and how do you think individual differences across and within groups contributed to the differences?

-   With your group, come up with a research question.
