## Probabilities

::: callout-note
**Probability**

-   Probability of an event occurring.

-   Probabilities can only be **between 0 and 1**.

    -   ‚õîÔ∏è 0 means **impossible**.
    -   ü§∑ 0.5 means **it can happen but it can also not happen**.
    -   ‚úÖ 1 means **certain**.

### **Probability**

-   Probability of an event occurring: 0 to 100% probability.

-   **Probability of a statistical variable being some numeric value**: a bit more complicated...

## Probability distributions

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
A **probability distribution** describes *how the probabilities are distributed over the values* that a variable can take on.

### Two types of probability distributions

- Discrete probability distributions.

- Continuous probability distributions.

You learned about discrete and continuous variables in Week 2!

**Discrete variables (numeric or categorical) follow discrete probability distributions and continuous variables follow continuous probability distributions.**

## Gaussian data

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_light())
library(brms)
```

```{r}
set.seed(81239)
height <- round(rnorm(200, 165, 8))
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  aes(height) +
  geom_density(fill = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_rug(alpha = 0.25)
```
