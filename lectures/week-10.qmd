## Case study 1: @amoruso2025

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   @amoruso2025 published in Nature in November: "Multilingualism protects against accelerated ageing"

-   They argue that being multilingual reduces the effects of ageing.

> Specifically, speaking one foreign language were 1.3 times less likely (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71–0.83), two foreign languages 1.96 times less likely (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.47–0.55), and three or more foreign languages 1.56 times less likely (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.59–0.69).
> These findings underscore the protective effect of multilingualism on aging trajectories.

## Causal narrative but no causal inference

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
> While this approach provides evidence of temporal precedence, it does not establish causality.
> Proper causal inference would require experimental, quasi-experimental or intervention-based designs.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Problematic for two reasons:

-   "protects" is causal.

-   Causal Inference can be achieved with observational studies when using causal inference approaches, like Directed Acyclic Graphs.

So, are you a (social) scientist struggling with this situation? A break between what you _want_ to study (a causal process) and what you feel you _can_ credibly study (a correlation)?

Here are some readings that might help. 👇<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:yxdspbpbzu6k26jh3dmmzm7c/post/3m5dzm5v3xs2t?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Dan de Kadt  (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:yxdspbpbzu6k26jh3dmmzm7c?ref_src=embed">@dandekadt.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:yxdspbpbzu6k26jh3dmmzm7c/post/3m5dzm5v3xs2t?ref_src=embed">11 November 2025 at 11:24</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Missing variables

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   **Childhood socio-economic background** (parental education, early-life deprivation)
-   **Lifetime SES** (income, wealth, occupational class)
-   **Individual migration history** (country of birth, age at migration, duration of residence)
-   **Detailed multilingualism measures** (age of acquisition, proficiency, frequency of use, context of use)
-   **Genetic predispositions** (e.g., APOE, family history of dementia)
-   **Early-life health factors** (childhood illnesses, nutrition, developmental conditions)
-   **Additional health behaviours** (smoking, diet, exercise, alcohol misuse, social networks)
-   **Survey/measurement-related factors** (selection bias, attrition, exposure misclassification)
-   **Time-varying confounders** (changes in SES, language use, and health over the life course)

## Case study 2: intrinsic vowel duration

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   Intrinsic vowel duration: high vowels are shorter and low vowels are longer [@lieberman1979].

-   Three explanatory models:

    (a) Duration as articulatory distance [@turk1994].

    (b) Duration as a vowel-specific target [@toivonen2015; @bermudezotero2010].

    (c) Both articulatory distance and vowel-specific target [@coretta2025b].
:::

## @coretta2025b: Directed Acyclic Graphs

![DAGs representing three explanatory models of intrinsic vowel duration.](/img/vdur-dags-3a.png){#fig-dags fig-align="center"}

. . .

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   @coretta2025b suggests C: articulatory distance + (possibly) vowel-specific target.
:::

## Limitations

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   F1 is only a proxy for articulation: it conflates articulatory distance and peak velocity.

-   There might be other explanations than "vowel-specific category".
    For example, optimisation process in the XT/3C model [@turk2020; @turk2020b; @elie2023; @elie2024; @elie2024a].
:::

## Future study

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   Direct articulatory data.

-   Revised Directed Acyclic Graphs.

-   Framing in light of alternative explanations.
:::

## Explanatory models

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
(a) Duration as articulatory distance.

(b) Duration as other than articulatory distance (different possible processes: categorical specification or optimisation process).

(c) Both articulatory distance and other than articulatory distance (different possible processes: categorical specification or optimisation process).
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   Differentiate between categorical specification and optimisation.
:::

## Revised DAG

[DAGitty](https://www.dagitty.net/dags.html) demo.

## Adjustment sets

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
To estimate the direct causal effect of vowel and speech rate on distance:

-   No adjustment needed.

To estimate the direct causal effect of distance on peak velocity:

-   vowel, speech rate.

To estimate the direct causal effect of distance on duration:

-   vowel, speech rate, peak velocity.
:::

## Power law and log-log form

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_p & = k \cdot D^\alpha\\
ln(V_p) & = ln(k) + \alpha \cdot ln(D)
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   Peak velocity $V_p$ is equal to the product of a constant $k$ and distance $D$ raised to the power of $\alpha$.

-   Equivalently, logged peak velocity is equal to logged $k$ plus the product of $\alpha$ and logged distance.
:::

. . .

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x
$$

. . .

<div>

In R: `log(dur) ~ 1 + log(dist)`

</div>

## Multivariate regression model

``` r
ivd_bf <- bf(
  dist_log ~ vowel + speech_rate_log + (vowel | speaker),
  
  pvel_log ~ dist_log * vowel + speech_rate_log + (dist_log * vowel | speaker),
  
  dur_log ~ dist_log * vowel + pvel_log * vowel + speech_rate_log +
    (dist_log * vowel + pvel_log * vowel | speaker)
)
```

. . .

Then

``` r
ivd_bm <- brm(
  ivd_bf,
  family = gaussian,
  data = ...
)
```

## Good luck!
