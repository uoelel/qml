We will use the `polite` data again.\n\nThis is the plot you previously made. Try and reproduce it by writing the code yourself (you also have to read in the data!).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot of mean f0 and H1-H2 difference.](plot-faceting_files/figure-html/fig-polite-1.png){#fig-polite width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Does being a music student matter?\n\nThat looks great, but we want to know if being a music student has an effect on the relationship of `f0mn` and `H1H2`.\n\nIn the plot above, the aesthetics mappings are the following:\n\n-   `f0mn` on the *x*-axis.\n-   `H1H2` on the *y*-axis.\n-   `gender` as colour.\n\nHow can we separate data further depending on whether the participant is a music student or not (`musicstudent`)?\n\nWe can create panels using `facet_grid()`. This function takes lists of variables to specify panels in rows and/or columns.\n\n#### Faceting\n\n**Faceting** a plot allows to split the plot into multiple panels, arranged in rows and columns, based on one or more variables.\n\nTo facet a plot, use the `facet_grid()` function.\n\nThe syntax is a bit strange. You can specify rows of panels with the `rows` argument and columns of panels with `cols` argument, but you have to include column names inside `vars()`, like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolite |>\n  ggplot(aes(f0mn, H1H2, colour = gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(musicstudent)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Mean f0 (Hz)\",\n    y = \"H1-H2 difference (dB)\",\n    colour = \"Gender\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot of mean f0 and H1-H2 difference in non-music students (left) vs music students (right).](plot-faceting_files/figure-html/fig-polite-facet-1.png){#fig-polite-facet width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou could write a description of this plot like this:\n\n> @fig-polite-facet shows mean f0 and H1-H2 difference as a scatter plot. The two panels indicate whether the participant was a student of music. Within each panel, the participant's gender is represented by colour (red for female and blue for male). Male participants tend to have higher H1-H2 differences and lower mean f0 than females. From the plot it can also be seen that there is greater variability in H1-H2 difference in female music students compared to female non-music participants. Within each group of gender by music student there does not seem to be any specific relation between mean f0 and H1-H2 difference.\n\nThe `polite` data also has a column `attitude` with values `inf` for informal and `pol` for polite. Subjects were asked to speak either as if they were talking to a friend (`inf` attitude) or to someone with a higher status (`pol` attitude).\n\nRecreate the last plot, this time faceting also by `attitude`. Use the `rows` column to create two separate rows for each value of `attitude`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolite |>\n  ggplot(aes(f0mn, H1H2, colour = gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(musicstudent), rows = ...)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow write a description of the plot.\n",
