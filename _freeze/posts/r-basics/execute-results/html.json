There are several groups that promote R in minority/minoritised groups, like [R-Ladies](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/r-ladies), [Africa R](https://r4africa.org), and [Rainbow R](https://rainbowr.netlify.app) just to mention a few.\n\nMoreover, R is **open source and free**!\n\n## R vs RStudio\n\nBeginners usually have trouble understanding the difference between R and RStudio.\n\nLet's use a car analogy.\n\nWhat makes the car go is the **engine** and you can control the engine through the **dashboard**.\n\nYou can think of R as an engine and RStudio as the dashboard.\n\n![](../img/R_vs_RStudio_1.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n### R\n\n-   R is a **programming language**.\n\n-   We use programming languages to **interact** with computers.\n\n-   You run **commands** written in a **console** and the related task is **executed**.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n### RStudio\n\n-   RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment or **IDE**.\n\n-   It helps you using R more **efficiently**.\n\n-   It has a **graphical user interface** or GUI.\n:::\n\nThe next section will give you a tour of RStudio.\n\n## RStudio\n\nWhen you open RStudio, you can see the window is divided into 3 panels:\n\n-   Blue (left): the **Console**.\n\n-   Green (top-right): the **Environment tab**.\n\n-   Purple (bottom-right): the **Files tab**.\n\n![](/img/rstudio-1-2.png)\n\nThe **Console** is where R commands can be executed. Think of this as the interface to R.\n\nThe **Environment tab** lists the objects created with R, while in the **Files tab** you can navigate folders on your computer to get to files and open them in the file Editor.\n\n### RStudio projects\n\nRStudio is an IDE (see above) which allows you to work efficiently with R, all in one place.\n\n**Note** that files and data live in folders on your computer, outside of RStudio: do not think of RStudio as an app where you can save files in.\n\nAll the files that you see in the Files tab are files on your computer and you can access them from the Finder or File Explorer as you would with any other file.\n\nIn principle, you can open RStudio and then navigate to any folder or file on your computer.\n\nHowever, there is a more efficient way of working with RStudio: **RStudio Projects**.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### RStudio Projects\n\nAn **RStudio Project** is a folder on your computer that has an `.Rproj` file.\n:::\n\nYou can create as many RStudio Projects as you wish, and I recommend to create one per project (your dissertation, a research project, a course, etc...).\n\nWe will create an RStudio Project for this course (meaning, you will create a folder for the course which will be the RStudio Project). You will have to use this project/folder throughout the semester.\n\nTo create a new RStudio Project, click on the button that looks like a transparent light blue box with a plus, in the top-left corner of RStudio. A window like the one below will pop up.\n\n![](../img/rstudio-3.png)\n\nClick on `New Directory` then `New Project`.\n\n![](../img/rstudio-4.png)\n\nNow, this will create a new folder (aka directory) on your computer and will make that an RStudio Project (meaning, it will add a file with the `.Rproj` extension to the folder; the name of the file will be the name of the project/folder).\n\nGive a name to your new project, something like the name of the course and year (e.g. `qml-2023`).\n\nThen you need to specify where to create this new folder/Project. Click on `Browseâ€¦` and navigate to the folder you want to create the new folder/Project in.\n\nWhen done, click on `Create Project`. RStudio will automatically open your new project.\n\n![](../img/rstudio-5.png)\n\n::: callout-warning\n#### Important\n\nWhen working through these tutorials, always make sure you are in the course RStudio Project you just created.\n\nYou know you are in an RStudio Project because you can see the name of the Project in the top-right corner of RStudio, next to the light blue cube icon.\n\nIf you see `Project (none)` in the top-right corner, that means your **are not** in an RStudio Project.\n\nTo make sure you are in the RStudio project, go to the project folder in File Explorer or Finder and double click on the `.Rproj` file.\n:::\n\nThere are several ways of opening an RStudio Project:\n\n-   You can go to the RStudio Project folder in Finder or File Explorer and double click on the `.Rproj` file.\n\n-   You can click on `File > Open Project` in the RStudio menu.\n\n-   You can click on the project name in the top-right corner of RStudio, which will bring up a list of projects. Click on the desired project to open it.\n\n### A few important settings\n\nBefore moving on, there are a few important settings that you need to change.\n\n![](../img/rstudio-6.png)\n\n1.  Open the RStudio preferences (`Tools > Global options...`).\n\n2.  Un-tick `Restore .RData into workspace at startup`.\n\n    -   This mean that every time you start RStudio you are working with a clean Environment. Not restoring the workspace ensures that the code you write is fully reproducible.\n\n3.  Select `Never` in `Save workspace to .RData on exit`.\n\n    -   Since we are not restoring the workspace at startup, we don't need to save it. Remember that as long as you save the code, you will not lose any of your work! You will learn how to save code from next week.\n\n4.  Click `OK` to confirm the changes.\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Quiz 1\n\n\n\n**True or false?** \n\na. RStudio executes the code. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select> \n\nb.

If not, not to worry! Make sure you understand the concept highlighted in the green boxes and practice the related skills.\n\nFor this tutorial, you will just run code directly in the R Console in RStudio, i.e. you will type code in the Console and press `ENTER` to run it.\n\nIn future tutorials, you will learn how to save your code in a script file, so that you can keep track of which code you have run and make your work reproducible.\n\n### R as a calculator\n\nWrite this code `1 + 2` in the `Console`, then press `ENTER/RETURN` to run the code.\n\nFantastic! You should see that the answer of the addition has been printed in the `Console`, like this:\n\n```         \n[1] 3\n```\n\n(Never mind the `[1]` part for now).\n\nNow, try some more operations (write each of the following in the Console and press `ENTER`). Feel free to add your own operations to the mix!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n67 - 13\n2 * 4\n268 / 43\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can also chain multiple operations.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n6 + 4 - 1 + 2\n4 * 2 + 3 * 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Quiz 2\n\n\n\n**Are the following pairs of operations equivalent?** \n\na. `3 * 2 / 4` = `3 * (2 / 4)` <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select> \n\nb. `10 * 2 + 5 * 0.2` = `(10 * 2 + 5) * 0.2` <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select> \n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n## Extra: Arithmetics\n\nIf you need a maths refresher, I recommend checking the following pages:\n\n-   <https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/order-of-operations.html>\n\n-   <https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction.html>\n:::\n\n### Variables\n\n> Forget-me-not.\n\nMost times, we want to store a certain value so that we can use it again later.\n\nWe can achieve this by creating **variables**.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Variable\n\nA **variable** holds one or more values and it's stored in the computer memory for later use.\n:::\n\nYou can create a variable by using the **assignment operator** `<-`.\n\nLet's assign the value `156` to the variable `my_num`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_num <- 156\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, check the list of variables in the `Environment` tab of the top-right panel of RStudio. You should see the `my_num` variable and its value there.\n\nNow, you can just call the variable back when you need it! Write the following in the Console and press `ENTER`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_num\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 156\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nA variable like `my_num` is also called a **numeric vector**: i.e. a vector that contains a number (hence numeric).\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Vector\n\nA **vector** is an R object that contains one or more values of the same type.\n:::\n\nA vector is a type of variable and a numeric vector is a type of vector. However, it's fine in most cases to use the word variable to mean vector (just note that a variable can also be something else than a vector; you will learn about other R objects from next week).\n\nLet's now try some operations using variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nincome <- 1200\nexpenses <- 500\nincome - expenses\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 700\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSee? You can use operations with variables too!\n\nAnd you can also go all the way with variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsavings <- income - expenses\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd check the value...\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsavings\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 700\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nVectors can hold more than one item or value.\n\nJust use the combine `c()` function to create a vector containing multiple values.\n\nThe following are all numeric vectors.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_i <- 6\n# Vector with 2 values\ntwo_i <- c(6, 8)\n# Vector with 3 values\nthree_i <- c(6, 8, 42)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nCheck the list of variables in the `Environment` tab. You will see now that before the values of `two_i` and `three_i` you get the vector type `num` for numeric. (If the vector has only one value, you don't see the type in the `Enviroment` list but it is still of a specific type).\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Numeric vector\n\nA **numeric vector** is a vector that holds one or more numeric values.\n:::\n\nNote that the following are the same:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_i <- 6\none_i\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_ii <- c(6)\none_ii\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnother important aspect of variables is that they are... **variable**! Meaning that once you assign a value to one variable, you can overwrite the value by assigning a new one to the same variable.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_num <- 88\nmy_num <- 63\nmy_num\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 63\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Quiz 3\n\n\n\n**True or false?** \n\na. A vector is a type of variable. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select> \n\nb. Not all variables are vectors. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select> \n\nc. A numeric vector can only hold numeric values. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select> \n\n\n:::\n\n### Functions\n\n> R cannot function without... functions.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Function\n\nA **function** usually runs an operation on one or more specified **arguments**.\n:::\n\nA function in R has the form `function()` where:\n\n-   `function` is the name of the function, like `sum`.\n-   `()` are round parentheses, inside of which you write arguments, separated by commas.\n\nLet's see an example:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(3, 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `sum()` function sums the number listed as arguments. Above, the arguments are `3` and `5`.\n\nAnd of course arguments can be vectors!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_nums <- c(3, 5, 7)\n\nsum(my_nums)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 15\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(my_nums)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Quiz 4\n\n\n\n**True or false?** \n\na. Functions can take other functions as arguments. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select> \n\nb. All function arguments must be specified. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select> \n\nc. All functions need at least one argument. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select> \n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hint\n\nThe `Sys.Date()` function and other functions like it don't take any arguments.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Extra: R vs Python\n\nIf you are familiar with Python, you will soon realise that R and Python, although they share many concepts and types of objects, they can differ substantially. This is because R is a **functional** programming language (based on *functions*) while Python is an **Object Oriented** programming language (based on *methods* applied on objects).\n\nGenerally speaking, functions look like `print(x)` while methods look like `x.print()`\n:::\n\n### String and logical vectors\n\n> Not just numbers.\n\nWe have seen that variables can hold numeric vectors. But vectors are not restricted to being numeric. They can also store **strings**.\n\nA string is basically a set of characters (a word, a sentence, a full text).\n\nIn R, strings have to be **quoted** using double quotes `\" \"`.\n\nChange the following strings to your name and surname. Remember to keep the double quotes\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nname <- \"Stefano\"\nsurname <- \"Coretta\"\n\nname\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Stefano\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nStrings can be used as arguments in functions, like numbers can.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nMy name is Stefano Coretta\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nRemember that you can reuse the same variable name to override the variable value.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nname <- \"Raj\"\n\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nMy name is Raj Coretta\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can combine multiple strings into a **character vector**, using `c()`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Character vector\n\nA **character vector** is a vector that holds one or more strings.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfruit <- c(\"apple\", \"oranges\", \"bananas\")\nfruit\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"apple\"   \"oranges\" \"bananas\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nCheck the Environment tab. Character vectors have `chr` before the values.\n\nAnother type of vector is one that contains either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Vectors of this type are called **logical vectors** and they are listed as `logi` in the `Environment` tab.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Logical vector\n\nA **logical vector** is a vector that holds one or more `TRUE` or `FALSE` values.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngroceries <- c(\"apple\", \"flour\", \"margarine\", \"sugar\")\nin_pantry <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n\ndata.frame(groceries, in_pantry)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"groceries\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"in_pantry\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"lgl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"apple\",\"2\":\"TRUE\"},{\"1\":\"flour\",\"2\":\"TRUE\"},{\"1\":\"margarine\",\"2\":\"FALSE\"},{\"1\":\"sugar\",\"2\":\"TRUE\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n`TRUE` and `FALSE` values must be written in all capitals and *without* double quotes (they are not strings!).\n\n(We will talk about data frames, another type of object in R, in the following weeks.)\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Quiz 5\n\n\n\na.

A vector cannot have a mix of types of elements: they have to be all numbers or all strings or else, but not some numbers and some strings. Numbers are special in that if you include a number in a character vector without quoting it, it is automatically converted into a string. Try the following:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchar <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nchar <- c(char, 1)\nchar\nclass(char)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n-   `c(letters)` is a character vector because `letters` contains the letters of the alphabet as strings (this vector comes with base R).\n\n-   `c(apple)` is not a character vector because the variable `apple` holds a number, `45`!\n\n**5b**\n\n-   `\"FALSE\"` is **not** a logical vector because `FALSE` has been quoted (anything that is quoted is a string!).\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Extra: For-loops and if-else statements\n\nThis course does not cover programming in R in the strict sense, but if you are curious here's a short primer on for-loops and if-else statements in R.\n\n**For-loops**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfruits <- c(\"apples\", \"mangos\", \"durians\")\n\nfor (fruit in fruits) {\n  cat(\"I like\", fruit, \"\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nI like apples \nI like mangos \nI like durians \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**If-else**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (fruit in fruits) {\n  if (grepl(\"n\", fruit)) {\n    cat(fruit, \"has an 'n'\", \"\\n\")\n  } else {\n    cat(fruit, \"does not have an 'n'\", \"\\n\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\napples does not have an 'n' \nmangos has an 'n' \ndurians has an 'n' \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFor more, check the [For loops](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/base-r#for-loops) section of the R4DS book and the [R if else statement](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/if-else-statement) post from DataMentor.\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\nYou made it!
