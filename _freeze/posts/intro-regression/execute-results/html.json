Somewhat more specifically, regression models use the given data to estimate the set of parameters of the equation that is believed to have generated the data.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Why \"regression\"?\n\nRegression models are called that because of the paper [Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2841583) by Francis Galton. In the paper, Galton introduces the concept of regression towards the mean as observed in the height of parents and children.\n\nGalton noticed that children of tall parents weren't necessarily as tall as their parents and that children of short parents weren't necessarily short, but rather children were overall closer to the mean height than what would be expected based on the height of their parents.\n\nWhen plotting the height of the parents against the height of the children, Galton identified an average line towards which children's height seem to be drawn.\n\nThis line was later called *regression line*.\n\nGalton was a eugenicist and a racist and used the concept of regression to justify \"racial purity\". We are now stuck with the term *regression*, but Galton's idea about purity have been strongly rejected by scholars.\n:::\n\nThe following formula illustrates the simplest regression model possible:\n\n$$\ny \\sim Gaussian(\\mu, \\sigma)\n$$\n\n-   $y$ is the data\n\n-   $\\sim$ means \"is distributed according to\", or \"is generated by\".\n\n-   $Gaussian(\\mu, \\sigma)$ is a Gaussian probability distribution with the parameters $\\mu$ ([mjuː], the mean) and $\\sigma$ ([ˈsɪgmə], the standard deviation).\n\n## Simulating Gaussian data\n\nLet's move onto an example of how we can use regression models to estimate the mean and standard deviation of data that is distributed according to a Gaussian probability distribution.\n\nAlas, it is very difficult to find in nature data that is truly Gaussian, so we will simulate some.\n\nTo make things a little bit more worldly, we will simulate data of human adult height.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(62854)\n\nheight <- tibble(\n  h = round(rnorm(200, 165, 8))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheight |> \n  ggplot(aes(h)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"darkgreen\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_rug() +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(h)), colour = \"purple\", linewidth = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](intro-regression_files/figure-html/height-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Regression models in R\n\nR offers several options for fitting regression models. In this course you will be introduced to a more modern and robust approach to regression modelling using the R package [brms](http://paulbuerkner.com/brms/).\n\nbrms fits Bayesian regression models and it is a very flexible package that allows you to model a lot of different types of variables. You don't really need to understand a lot of technical details to be able to effectively use the package and interpret the results, so in the course we will focus on how to use the package in the context of research, but if you are interested in the inner workings, feel free to read the documentation.\n\nOne useful thing to know is that brms is a bridge between R and the statistical programming software [Stan](https://mc-stan.org). Stan is a powerful piece of software that can fit any type of Bayesian models, not only regression models. What brms does is that it allows you to write regression models in R, which are translated into Stan models and run with Stan under the hood.\n\nYou can safely use brms without learning Stan, but if you are interested in the computational aspects of Stan, you can check the [Stan documentation](https://mc-stan.org).\n\nThe following sections will guide you through the steps to fit, interpret and plot your first Bayesian regression model!\n\n## Fitting a regression model with brms\n\n\nThe first thing to do is of course to attach the brms package.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(brms)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can then fit a regression model with the `brm()` function, short for Bayesian Regression Model.\n\nThe minimal arguments you need are a model formula, a distribution family, and the data you want to fit the formula to.\n\n- `h ~ 1` and `family = gaussian` simply tell brms to model `h` with a Gaussian distribution. This means that a mean and a standard deviation will be estimated from the data.\n- We specify the data with `data = height`.\n\nThis model correspond to the following mathematical formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{height} \\sim Gaussian(\\mu, \\sigma)\n$$\n\nThe last argument you see in the code below, `chain = 1`, is related to the algorithm that Stan uses to fit the model and obtain estimates for the model's parameters (in this model, these are the mean and the standard deviation of height). Stan uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The algorithm is run by default four times; in technical terms, *four MCMC chains* are run. For this example we will just run one chain to speed things up, but in normal circumstance you would want to run four (you will learn how to run them in parallel in later tutorials).\n\nIf you want to learn more about the MCMC algorithm, check [Finding posteriors through sampling](https://elizabethpankratz.github.io/bayes_stat/day1/mcmc.html) by Elizabeth Pankratz and the resources linked there.\n\nNow, here is the code to fit this model with brms. When you run the code, text will be printed in the R Console or below the code if you are using a Quarto document. You can find it below the code here too. The messages in the text are related to Stan and the MCMC algorithm. `Compiling Stan program...` tells you that brms is instructing Stan to compile the model specified in R, and `Start sampling` tells us that the MCMC algorith has started. The rest of the messages are about the MCMC chains themselves. Since we are only running one chain, you see info for that chain only.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nh_1 <- brm(\n  h ~ 1,\n  family = gaussian,\n  data = height,\n  chain = 1\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nCompiling Stan program...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nStart sampling\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nSAMPLING FOR MODEL 'anon_model' NOW (CHAIN 1).\nChain 1: \nChain 1: Gradient evaluation took 2.4e-05 seconds\nChain 1: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.24 seconds.\nChain 1: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\nChain 1: \nChain 1: \nChain 1: Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  200 / 2000 [ 10%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  400 / 2000 [ 20%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  600 / 2000 [ 30%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  800 / 2000 [ 40%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: \nChain 1:  Elapsed Time: 0.023 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 1:                0.02 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 1:                0.043 seconds (Total)\nChain 1: \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFantastic! When the model has finished running, `h_1` will have the model output for you to inspect.\n\n## Model summary\n\nThe natural way to inspect a model object like `h_1`, is to use the `summary()` function, which prints the model summary.\n\nLet's inspect the summary of the model now.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(h_1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: h ~ 1 \n   Data: height (Number of observations: 200) \n  Draws: 1 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 1000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n          Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept   165.19      0.59   164.02   166.30 1.00      535      531\n\nFurther Distributional Parameters:\n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     8.39      0.43     7.58     9.28 1.00      694      498\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's break that down bit by bit:\n\n-   The first few lines are a reminder of the model we fitted:\n\n    -   `Family` is the chosen distribution for the outcome variable, a Gaussian distribution.\n\n    -   `Links` lists the link functions.\n\n    -   `Formula` is the model formula.\n\n    -   `Data` reports the name of the data and the number of observations.\n\n    -   Finally, `Draws` has information about the MCMC draws.\n\n-   Then, the `Regression Coefficients` are listed as a table. In this model we only have one regression coefficient, `Intercept` which corresponds to $\\mu$ from the formula above. You will learn more about the `Regression Coefficients` table below.\n\n-   Then `Further distributional parameters` are tabled. Here we only have `sigma` which is $\\sigma$ from the formula above. The table has the same columns as the `Regression Coefficients` table.\n\n## Posterior probability distributions\n\nThe `Regression Coefficients` table is the most important part of the model summary, the part that gives you information on the estimates of the model parameters.\n\nThe main characteristics of Bayesian regressions is that they don't just provide you with a single numeric estimate for the model parameters. Rather, the model estimates a *full probability distribution* for each parameter/coefficient. These probability distributions are called **posterior probability distributions** (or posteriors for short).\n\nThey are called *posterior* because they are derived from the data (and the prior probability distributions, you will learn more about these later).\n\nThe `Regression Coefficients` table reports a few summary measures of these posterior distributions. Here, we only have the summary measures of one posterior: the posterior of the model's mean $\\mu$. The table also has three diagnostic measures, which you can ignore for now.\n\nHere's a break down of the table's columns:\n\n-   `Estimate`, the mean estimate of the coefficient (i.e. the mean of the posterior distribution of the coefficient).\n\n-   `Est.error`, the error of the mean estimate (i.e. the standard deviation of the posterior distribution of the coefficient).\n\n-   `l-95% CI` and `u-95% CI`, the lower and upper limits of the 95% Bayesian Credible Interval (more on these below).\n\n-   `Rhat`, `Bulk_ESS`, `Tail_ESS` are diagnostics of the MCMC chains.\n\n## Plotting the posterior distributions\n\nWhile the model summary reports *summaries* of the posterior distributions, it is always helpful to *plot* the posteriors.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(h_1, combo = c(\"dens\", \"trace\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](intro-regression_files/figure-html/h-1-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the posterior distribution of the estimated coefficient `b_Intercept` and `sigma`, which correspond to the $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ of the formula above, respectively.\n\nFor the `b_Intercept` coefficient, the posterior probability encompasses values between 163 and 167 cm, approximately. But some values are more probable then others: the values in the centre of the distribution have a higher probability density then the values on the sides. In other words, values around 165 cm are more probable than values below 164 and above 166, for example.\n\nHowever, looking at a full probability distribution like that is not super straightforward. Credible Intervals (CrIs) help summarise the posterior distributions so that interpretation is more straightforward.\n\n## Interpreting Credible Intervals\n\nThe model summary reports the Bayesian Credible Intervals (CrIs) of the posterior distributions.\n\nAnother way of obtaining summaries of the coefficients is to use the `posterior_summary()` function. Ignore the last three lines.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nposterior_summary(h_1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n               Estimate  Est.Error        Q2.5       Q97.5\nb_Intercept  165.188975 0.58641126  164.023908  166.303072\nsigma          8.391712 0.42565293    7.584844    9.279723\nIntercept    165.188975 0.58641126  164.023908  166.303072\nlprior        -6.030282 0.06212402   -6.160126   -5.914505\nlp__        -712.569786 0.98626592 -715.219667 -711.585583\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe 95% CrI of the `b_Intercept` is between 164 and 166. This means there is a 95% probability, or that we can be 95% confident, that the `Intercept` value is within that range.\n\nFor `sigma`, the 95% CrI is between 7.6 and 9.3. So, again, there is a 95% probability that the `sigma` value is between those values.\n\nSo, to summarise, **a 95% CrI tells us that we can be 95% confident, or in other words that there is a 95% probability, that the value of the coefficient is between the values of the CrI.**\n\nHere you have the results from the regression model. Really, the results of the model are the full posterior probabilitis, but it makes things easier to focus on the CrI.\n\nThe model has \"recovered\" the values we used to simulate the height data quite well: above, we used a mean of 165 and a standard deviation of 8 to simulate data. The model is suggesting that the mean and SD of `h` is between 164-166 cm and 7-9 cm respectively: quite neat!\n\nRegression models work.\n\n## Reporting\n\nWhat about reporting the model in writing? We could report the model and the results like this.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWe fitted a Bayesian regression using the brms package [XXX] in R [XXX]. The outcome variable was height and we did not include any predictor, to estimate the overall mean and standard deviation of height.\n\nBased on the model results, there is a 95% probability that the mean is between 164 and 166 cm and that the standard deviation is between 7.6 and 9.3 cm.\n:::\n\n## What's next\n\nIn this post you have learnt the very basics of Bayesian regression models. As mentioned above, regression models with brms are very flexible and you can easily fit very complex models with a variety of distribution families (for a list, see `?brmsfamily`; you can even define your own distributions!).\n\nThe perk of using brms is that you can just learn the basics of one package and one approach and use it to fit a large variety of regression models.\n\nThis is different from the standard frequentis approach, where different models require different packages or functions, with their different syntax and quirks.\n\nIn the folllowing posts, you will build your understanding of Bayesian regression models, which will enable you to approach even the most complex models! However, due to time limits you won't learn everything there is to learn.\n\nDeveloping conceptual and practical skills in quantitative methods is a long-term process and unfortunately one semester will not be enough. So be prepared to continue your learning journey for years to come!\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Next\n\n- [Introduction to regression models (Part II): include numeric predictors](intro-regression-predictors.qmd)\n\n:::\n",
