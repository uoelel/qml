## Content overview

This page gathers all the important information about the course content and schedule. Each week is dedicated to a specific set of topics and you are expected to complete readings from the course textbook and homework by the beginning of the following week (so complete readings and homework of week 1 by the beginning of week 2, and so on).

Each week there will be a 50-minute lecture and a 2-hour workshop. The lecture covers the most important and/or difficult topics of the week, but you are expected to learn and understand all the topics of the week as treated in the readings from the course [textbook](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/qdal/). In the workshop you will further practice your R skills with group data [challenges](workshops.qmd) (with the exception of the workshop of week 1, where you will go through the R basics chapters in the textbook in class).

The **Schedule overview** below gives you an overview of each week, while the **Weekly schedule** is a more in-depth description of the activities and materials of each week.

## Schedule overview

The following table is a schedule overview of the course, with the topic of the lecture, workshop and assessments due (WSR = weekly self-reflection). See [Assessments](assessments.qmd) for more info on assessment.

#### Homework

**Course website**

-   Carefully read the [homepage](index.qmd).

-   Familiarise yourself with this *Course content* page, especially the Content overview and the Schedule overview.

**Intake form**

-   **You must complete the intake form before coming to the Tuesday lecture.**
-   The link to the form can be found on the Learn website.

**Install R and RStudio**

-   For this course, you need to install both R and RStudio.
-   You should install R and RStudio **before** coming to the workshop.
-   **NOTE**: If you have installed either R or RStudio prior to January 2025, please make sure you first delete both R and RStudio from your laptop and then reinstall the latest versions.
-   **Instructions**:
    -   Install R from <https://cloud.r-project.org>
    -   Install RStudio from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

#### Readings

-   Read Preface and Chapters 1, 2, 3 of the course [textbook](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/qdal/).
-   **Note that this week you are NOT expected to have completed this week's readings before class, but you ARE expected to complete the week's readings before the Workshop from Week 2 on!** You must plan ahead so that by the Workshop in Week 2 you have completed the readings of Week 1 *and* Week 2. You will not be able to complete the workshops from Week 2 on without having done the readings of that week (which means that you very likely have to start the readings of following week in the previous week).
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
#### Lecture

-   [Lecture slides](lectures/week-01.qmd).
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
#### Workshop

Go through [Chapter 4](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/qdal/ch-r-rstudio.html) and [Chapter 5](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/qdal/ch-packages.html) of the course [textbook](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/qdal/). You will start working in groups from next week since this week is probably easier to read and try things out solo, but feel free to work in group if it works for you!

The tutors will go around to ask how things are going and to answer questions or help.
