## Content overview

This page gathers all the important information about the course content and schedule. Each week is dedicated to a specific set of topics and you are expected to complete readings from the course textbook and homework by the beginning of the following week (so complete readings and homework of week 1 by the beginning of week 2, and so on).

Each week there will be a 50-minute lecture and a 2-hour workshop. The lecture covers the most important and/or difficult topics of the week, but you are expected to learn and understand all the topics of the week as treated in the readings from the course textbook. In the workshop you will further practice your R skills with group data [Challenges](challenges.qmd) (with the exception of the workshop of week 1, where you will go through the R basics chapters in the textbook in class).

The **Schedule overview** below gives you an overview of each week, while the **Weekly schedule** is a more in-depth description of the activities and materials of each week.

## Schedule overview

The following table is a schedule overview of the course. For each week, you can see the topics covered (divided into research, statistics and R specific topics), which assessments are due (WSR = weekly self-reflection), the topic of the lecture and the topic of the workshop.

| 5 |  | Regression modelling (numeric predictor) and posterior draws | Regression modelling with brms | WSR | Regression basics with brms | Regression basics and posteriors draws |
| 6 |  |  |  | Interim test 1 |  |  |
| 7 | Null Ritual | Regression (categorical predictor) | Treatment and indexing | WSR | Null Ritual | Categorical predictors in regression |
| 8 |  | Bernoulli regression | Bernoulli regression | WSR | Bernoulli regression | Bernoulli regression |

## Weekly schedule

### Week 1: Quantitative methods and uncertainty

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
#### Learning Objectives

**Questions**

-   What is quantitative data analysis?
-   What is the inference process?
-   How can we talk about uncertainty and variability?
-   Which are the limits of quantitative methods?

#### Homework

**Course website**

-   Carefully read the [homepage](index.qmd).

-   Familiarise yourself with this *Course content* page, especially the Content overview and the Schedule overview.

**Intake form**

-   **You must complete the intake form before coming to the Tuesday lecture.**
-   The link to the form can be found on the Learn website.

**Install R and RStudio**

-   For this course, you need to install both R and RStudio.
-   **NOTE**: If you have installed either R or RStudio prior to January 2025, please make sure you first delete both R and RStudio from your laptop.
-   Please, follow the instructions in the [Setup](setup.qmd) page.

#### Workshop

Go through the R basics chapters in class. You will start working in groups from next week since this week is probably easier to read and try things out solo, but feel free to work in group if it works for you!

The tutors will go around and ask how things are going and to answer questions or help.
