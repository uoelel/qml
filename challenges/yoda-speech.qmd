The [Yoda Speech Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanocoretta/yoda-speech-corpus/data) on Kaggle has dialogues from the Star Wars movies with Yoda as an interlocutor.

The dialogues are taken from the Star Wars movies 1-6, and they contain not only the lines spoken by Yoda, but also the lines from other characters that are involved in the particular dialogue.

Use this corpus to analyse the linguistic features of Yoda's speech.
