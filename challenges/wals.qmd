> The [World Atlas of Language Structures](https://wals.info) (WALS) is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors.

The data from WALS are available in R through the [ritwals](https://hkauhanen.github.io/ritwals/) package.

Use the WALS data to explore relationships between features, areal features, or anything else!
