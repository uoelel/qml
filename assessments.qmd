## Assessment overview

This course will be assessed on the basis of a set of online tests, **2 formative assessments** and **2 summative assessments**.

**Formative assessments** are mock assessments that mirror the summative assessments. These will give you a chance to keep on track with the course contents and get interim feedback that will better prepare you for the summative assessment. See below for info.

You will have to submit **two summative assessments**. They will weight 50% and 50% of the final mark.

See below for details.
