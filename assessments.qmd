## Assessment overview

This course will be **self-assessed on the basis of a portfolio** consisting of weekly-self reflections and a group project.

## Portfolio

Learning is an active process: it happens best when we're all engaged. Learning is also something that we can learn how to do better. Think of a hobby you might have or a skill you've learned: you've probably perfected it for a while, paying close attention to what did or didn't work.

That's why both students and the instructor will reflect on how the course is going and what they've learned. After each class we'll all write short self-reflections. I'll also comment on yours and you'll be able to comment on mine. Together, these will form our **Portfolios**. At the mid-term point and at the end of the semester, we'll take stock of what we've learned, as documented in the Portfolio.

Each of us will have our own Portfolio on Learn. The tutors and I will be able to see your Portfolio, but you won't be able to see other students' Portfolios. My Portfolio (the instructor's) will be visible to all and you will also be able to comment on it.

Your Portfolio will have a list of entries which will be your **weekly self-reflections** and the **group project reflection**.

### Weekly self-reflections

After every class you'll need to write one self-reflection in the Portfolio on Learn. Afterwards you need to read my feedback on your entries.

What happens is:

1. We have class.
2. We reflect on what we've learned and what our expectations are for next class.
3. We write down brief reflections (1-paragraph) in one entry in the Portfolio on Learn, e.g. one titled "Week 1 Seminar", "Week 1 Lab", and so on.
4. I comment on your reflections, and you might comment on mine.
6. I might also give general feedback in a collaborative discussion in class or via Learn announcements.

In sum: after any given class, you'll write a short self-reflection. Within a reasonable amount of time, I'll react to these.

### Group project

## Feedback and marking

**Feedback** will be provided to you (1) during class, (2) as comments on your weekly self-reflections and (3) during office hours (it is up to you to book meetings with me and/or the tutors).

This course is **self-assessed with co-moderation,** which means that at the end of the course you will assign yourself a mark and the mark will be moderated in conversation between you and the Course Organiser.

### Self-assessment with co-moderation

-   Based on your learning, you assign yourself a mark (see section on impression-based step marking.

-   The Course Organiser will moderate the self-assigned mark as part of a dialogue with you.
:::

### Impression-based step marking

To help you thinking about which mark to assign yourself, we will use an "impression-based step marking" procedure. The procedure works as follows:

-   First, think about the mark band you think you deserve.
-   Then, choose a step within the band (see below for an explanation).

Once you pick a mark band, you need to pick a step within that band. Within each mark band, there are three steps: 2, 5 or 8 (for example, in the 60s band there is 62, 65 or 68). The criteria for each of 2, 5, or 8 are the following:

| Step | Criteria                                                                            |
|:-------:|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|  2   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved, but there might be minor issues. |
|  5   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved satisfactorily.                   |
|  8   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved fully.                            |
