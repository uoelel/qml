## Assessment overview

This course will be **self-assessed on the basis of a portfolio** consisting of weekly-self reflections and a group project.

## Weekly self-reflections

## Group project

## Feedback and marking

**Feedback** will be provided to you (1) during class, (2) as comments on your weekly self-reflections and (3) during office hours (it is up to you to book meetings with me and/or the tutors).

This course is **self-assessed with co-moderation,** which means that at the end of the course you will assign yourself a mark and the mark will be moderated in conversation between you and the Course Organiser.

### Self-assessment with co-moderation

-   Based on your learning, you assign yourself a mark (see section on impression-based step marking.

-   The Course Organiser will moderate the self-assigned mark as part of a dialogue with you.

### Impression-based step marking

To help you thinking about which mark to assign yourself, we will use an "impression-based step marking" procedure. The procedure works as follows:

-   First, think about the mark band you think you deserve.
-   Then, choose a step within the band (see below for an explanation).

Once you pick a mark band, you need to pick a step within that band. Within each mark band, there are three steps: 2, 5 or 8 (for example, in the 60s band there is 62, 65 or 68). The criteria for each of 2, 5, or 8 are the following:

| Step | Criteria                                                                            |
|:-------:|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|  2   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved, but there might be minor issues. |
|  5   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved satisfactorily.                   |
|  8   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved fully.                            |
