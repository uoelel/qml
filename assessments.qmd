## Assessment overview

This course will be **self-assessed on the basis of a portfolio** consisting of a Reflective Journal and a Group Project (including a Final Reflection).[^assessments-1]

## Reflective Journal

::: callout-important
### Deadlines

-   You should post your self-reflection **each week after you have attended** your classes.

-   There isn't a hard deadline and if necessary you can skip a week and post two reflections the week after.
:::

Learning is an active process: it happens best when we're all engaged. Learning is also something that we can learn how to do better. Think of a hobby you might have or a skill you've learned: you've probably perfected it for a while, paying close attention to what did or didn't work.

That's why both students and the lecturer (Stefano) will reflect on how the course is going and what they've learned. After each class we'll all write short self-reflections in the **Reflective Journal**. I'll also comment on yours and you'll be able to comment on mine.

Each of us will have our own Reflective Journal on Learn. The tutors and I will be able to see your Reflective Journal, but you won't be able to see other students' Journals. My Journal (the lecturer's) will be visible to all and you will also be able to comment on it.

### Weekly self-reflections

After every class you'll need to write one self-reflection in the Reflective Journal on Learn. Afterwards you need to read my feedback on your entries.

What happens is:

1.  We have class.
2.  We reflect on what we've learned and what our expectations are for next class.
3.  We write down brief reflections (1-paragraph) in one entry in the Reflective Journal on Learn, e.g. one titled "Week 1 Seminar", "Week 1 Lab", and so on.
4.  I comment on your reflections, and you might comment on mine.
5.  I might also give general feedback in a collaborative discussion in class or via Learn announcements.

In sum: after any given class, you'll write a short self-reflection. Within a reasonable amount of time, I'll react to these.

## Group project and Final Reflection

::: callout-important
### Deadline

-   You must submit your Final Reflection, including the product of your Group Project (see details below) by **Thursday 12 December at noon** on Learn \> Assessment.
:::

As part of the assessment you will have to work on a **Group Project**.

This project can be anything (some ideas below) so the structure of what you will have to submit differs depending on what you end up doing.

Independent of the type of project, you will have to write a **Final Reflection** on your experience with the course and with working on you Group Project. This reflection is what you submit to Learn by the deadline. The reflection should contain the "product" of your Group Project, either as text following the reflection or as a link (since the Group Project can be anything).

Some ideas for Group Projects:

-   Pick a linguistic question that interests you and run a mini quantitative study (this could well be a study where you also act as participants).

-   Find a linguistic topic and collect published effects from the relevant literature (the first step towards a full meta-analysis).

-   Design exercises and/or tutorials for the course using linguistic data.

-   Write a collection of sonnets on the replicability crisis.

- Write an essay on minoritised statisticians.

-   Choreograph an interpretative dance that illustrates that Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

## Feedback and marking

**Feedback** will be provided to you (1) during class, (2) as comments on your weekly self-reflections and (3) during office hours (it is up to you to book meetings with me and/or the tutors).

This course is **self-assessed with co-moderation,** which means that at the end of the course you will assign yourself a mark and the mark will be moderated in conversation between you and the Lecturer (Stefano)/Tutors. The conversation will happen either in a meeting or via email:

-   **If you would like to have a conversation**, I will arrange 15-minute meetings the week of December 16.

-   **If you don't want to have a conversation**, me or the Tutors will get in touch with you via email *only in the case that adjustments* to the mark have to be made (which in the experience of other colleagues using this approach happens quite rarely!).

### Self-assessment with co-moderation

-   Based on your learning, you assign yourself a mark (see section on impression-based step marking) when submitting the Final Reflection (by December 12).

-   The Course Organiser/Tutors will moderate the self-assigned mark as part of a dialogue with you.
:::

### Impression-based step-marking

To help you thinking about which mark to assign yourself, we will use an "impression-based step-marking" procedure. The procedure works as follows:

-   First, think about the mark band you think you deserve.
-   Then, choose a step within the band (see below for an explanation).

Once you pick a mark band, you need to pick a step within that band. You can find a description of the bands here: [Extended Common Marking Scheme](https://registryservices.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/exams/regulations/common-marking-scheme). Within each mark band, there are three steps: 2, 5 or 8 (for example, in the 60s band there is 62, 65 or 68). The criteria for each of 2, 5, or 8 are the following:

| Step | Criteria                                                                            |
|:---------------:|-------------------------------------------------------|
|  2   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved, but there might be minor issues. |
|  5   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved satisfactorily.                   |
|  8   | The criteria for the mark band have been achieved fully.                            |
