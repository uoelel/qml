(VOT is the time lag between the voicing onset and the consonant release).\nCreate a new column that specifies the voicing of the consonant (voiced or voiceless) based on the value in label. ifelse() or case_when() are useful.\nGet summary measures of VOT for voiceless and voiced consonants. Can the VOT differentiate between the two voicing categories?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask B: Albanian vowels\n\n\n\n\nRead the coretta2021/alb_formants.rds data.\nCreate a scatter plot of F1 and F2, with points coloured by vowel. Are the vowels in the places you’d expect them to be?\nNow create another scatter plot with F1 and vowel duration. You need to calculate vowel duration first from start and end. Can you notice any patterns in the relationship between F1 and vowel duration?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask C: ‘Everywhere here can say this’\n\n\n\n\nRead the slukin2022/everywhere-loc.csv data. The data are acceptability judgments on the impersonal use of “everywhere”, like in the sentence “Everywhere here can say this”.\nThe Restrictor column tells you if the sentence has a restrictor, like in “Everywhere on the coast eats fish and chips.” vs no restrictor “Everywhere takes credit cards these days.” The Value column gives you the acceptability rating from 1 to 7.\nMutate the Restrictor column so that 0 = “no restrictor” and 1 = “restrictor”.\nMutate the Value column so that it is a character column (use as.character()).\nCreate a filled stacked bar chart by Restrictor with fill by Value and panels by Age. Can you spot differences in rating across different age brackets?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\nFor feedback, ask us in class and/or send your work to Stefano and/or come to Stefano’s office hours (you can also come in groups).\nWe will not provide you with model answers, so make sure you make the most of us in person."

Learning is also something that we can learn how to do better. Think of a hobby you might have or a skill you’ve learned: you’ve probably perfected it for a while, paying close attention to what did or didn’t work.\nThat’s why both students and the lecturer (Stefano) will reflect on how the course is going and what they’ve learned. After each class we’ll all write short self-reflections in the Reflective Journal. I’ll also comment on yours and you’ll be able to comment on mine.\nEach of us will have our own Reflective Journal on Learn. The tutors and I will be able to see your Reflective Journal, but you won’t be able to see other students’ Journals. My Journal (the lecturer’s) will be visible to all and you will also be able to comment on it.\nHere are some example prompts to get you started, but you can really write what you want!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample prompts\n\n\n\n\nWhich Notebook entries/other materials did I go through this week?\nHow did I approach this week’s Challenge?\nWhat has changed in my thinking about quantitative methods so far (if at all)?\nHow would I describe my participation in class activities? Am I happy with it?\nIn what ways have I grown intellectually so far, if at all?\nIs there anything I’m particularly proud of?\nDid I struggle with anything? If so, did I ask for help?\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Instructions for Weekly self-reflections submission\nAfter every class you’ll need to write one self-reflection in the Reflective Journal on Learn. Afterwards you need to read our feedback on your entries.\nWhat happens is:\n\nWe have class.\nWe reflect on what we’ve learned and what our expectations are for next class.\nWe write down brief reflections (1-paragraph) in one entry in the Reflective Journal on Learn, e.g. one titled “Week 1 Seminar”, “Week 1 Lab”, and so on.\nI comment on your reflections, and you might comment on mine.\nI might also give general feedback in a collaborative discussion in class or via Learn announcements.\n\nIn sum: after any given class, you’ll write a short self-reflection. Within a reasonable amount of time, I’ll react to these."

    "text": "3 Group project and Final Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines\n\n\n\n\nYou must submit a Project Proposal to Turnitin by Thursday 7th November at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\nYou must submit your Final Reflection, including the product of your Group Project to Turnitin by Thursday 12th December at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Overview\nAs part of the assessment you will have to work on a Group Project.\nThis project can be anything (some ideas below) so the structure of what you will have to submit differs depending on what you end up doing.\nIndependent of the type of project, you will have to write a Final Reflection on your experience with the course and with working on you Group Project. This reflection is what you submit to Turnitin on Learn by the deadline of Thursday 12th December. The reflection should contain the “product” of your Group Project, either as text following the reflection or as a link (since the Group Project can be any of different types of products).\nThe requisites for the Group Project are the following:\n\nIt has to be about linguistics, i.e. research on Language and/or languages.\nIt has to be on knowledge-oriented (aka “basic”) research, not on application-oriented (aka “applied”) research.\nIt has to be in or on R.\n\nSome ideas for Group Projects:\n\nPick a linguistic question that interests you and run a mini quantitative study (this could well be a study where you also act as participants).\nFind a linguistic topic and collect published effects from the relevant literature (the first step towards a fully-fledged meta-analysis).\nDesign exercises and/or tutorials for the course using linguistic data.\nWrite a collection of sonnets on the replicability crisis.\nWrite an essay on minoritised statisticians.\nChoreograph an interpretative dance that illustrates how coefficients of a model of lexical decision task data are estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a regression model.\n\nNote that the project has to be on a “knowledge-oriented” topic, rather than on a application of statistics to practical problems or language processing/technology.\nSo for example the following project is fine: “Do participant respond faster when listening to synthetic speech generated by algorithm A vs those generated by algorithm B?” But the following projects will not be appropriate for the Group Project: “We want to write a speech-to-text algorithm in R” or “We will develop a natural language virtual assistant for online shopping” or “I will train a forced-aligner model for a new language”.\nAs explained above, you will have to submit a Final Reflection including the product or link to the product of the Group Project by by the deadline of Thursday 12th December at noon.\nFor any question about assessment, post your question on Piazza (unless it’s of a sensitive nature, then get in touch with Stefano).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nEach project will be different, so if you are unsure about how to approach your project idea or if you need help finding an idea in the first place, please get in touch with Stefano!\nStefano does not have telepathic powers (yet) and the only way for him to help you is for you to reach out. :)\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Instructions for Project proposal submission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadline\n\n\n\n\nYou must submit a Project Proposal to Turnitin by Thursday 7th November at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\n\n\n\n\nYou will have to submit a very short project proposal for approval by Thursday 7th November to Turnitin on Learn, but the earlier you submit the earlier you can start working on it! We will be checking submissions as they arrive and ask get in touch if there are any issues.\nOnly one person per group should submit the proposal (there is no need for everyone in the group to submit the project proposal and you can add all the names of the group members if you wish).\nA few sentences explaining the project will be sufficient. Note that this deadline is an informal deadline and there is no possibility of getting an extension.\n\nThe following boxes give you some examples of possible projects and project proposals, with an explanation on how you can go about completing these projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 1\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to replicate the study by Keogh et al. The study use an artificial language learning paradigm to test the relationship between working memory and regularisation. We will run the exact same experiment with 5 participants and conduct the same analysis they did.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is a replication project. You will need to understand the original study design, make sure you have the same materials and protocols and you will have to recruit 5 participants (these can be students from the QML course, including yourselves). After data collection, you should analyse the data as in the original study and write a short report focussing on the analysis approach and results. Specifically, you should discuss how the new results compare with the ones from the original study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 2\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to collect recordings of ourselves reading a passage to illustrate different accents. We will include accents from: Scotland, England, India, Tanzania and Hungary. We will curate the data by formatting it so that it’s FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and we will make it available on the Open Science Framework with a CC-BY license. The data will be thoroughly documented.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is a data curation project. You will collect, format, organise and document data which you will make available online. This requires learning about file data management, file formats, Open Research practices and principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 3\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to draw an abstract paining that represents the analysis approach used in Coretta et al.. The painting will be accompanied by a written piece with an explanation of the approach, our understanding and how this has shaped the painting.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is creative project. You will have to carefully read a paper, understand the analysis, which will likely be of a more advanced level compared to what you have learnt so far, and use your creativity to create a painting (no need to be artists to make a painting!). The written piece will have to show that you have understood and internalised the analysis and that this understanding has driven the production of the painting. What you submit is the written piece and high resolution photo of the painting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 4\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe are interested in the relationship between vowel height and vowel duration in Hungarian. We will run a small-scale study with recordings from 2 or 3 students who are speakers of Hungarian. We will analyse the vowel duration using Bayesian regression models.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is research project. You will have to think of a research question/hypothesis (they do not have to be novel and you can reuse existing questions/hypotheses) and collect and analyse data. Note that we are restricted by ethics requirements so you can’t record people that are not UoE students, unless you want to apply for ethics (which you can). The written report will have to focus on the data collection and analysis (you should put less focus on literature review and discussion).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 5\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to re-analyse the data from [Ota 2013]. The original study used frequentist regression models, but we will instead apply a Bayesian regression model.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is robustness assessment project. You will have to get hold of the original data and re-analyse it using a different approach than that in the original study. The report will describe the original approach and your approach, report the results and assess how these are different (if at all) from the original study’s results.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Instructions for Group Project and Final Reflection submission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadline\n\n\n\n\nYou must submit your Final Reflection, including the product of your Group Project, to Turnitin by Thursday 12th December at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\nNormal extensions are not possible, so carefully plan your time accordingly. Learning Adjustments and Special Circumstances extensions are possible. Note that LA/SC extensions do not extend to group-mates who don’t have LA/SC in place.\n\n\n\n\nYou should submit a PDF file.\nYou should use this Quarto document template (right-click and download). For the submission, please render the Quarto file to PDF (I suggest trying this as soon as you download the file, to ensure you have all the necessary software for rendering to PDF).\nEvery student should submit. Your submission should include the Group Project output or link to it (we will discard the similarity ratings on Turnitin).\nIn your submission, include the Group Project title and the NAMES of the members of the group (not the student number nor the exam number), including yourself, and your proposed mark for yourself (this should be done individually, not at the group level), as per the template linked above.\nIf you are unsure about anything, please post a question on Piazza."

The conversation will happen either in a meeting or via email:\n\nIf you would like to have a conversation, I have arranged 10-minute online meetings, or “exit interviews”, the week of December 16 (every day, between 1-5pm). You can book these from the usual booking system (link at the bottom of the course homepage).\nIf you don’t want to have a conversation, me or the Tutors will get in touch with you via email only in the case that adjustments to the mark have to be made (which in the experience of other colleagues using this approach happens quite rarely!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-assessment with co-moderation\n\n\n\n\nBased on your learning as evidenced by the Portfolio, you assign yourself a mark (see section on impression-based step marking) when submitting the Final Reflection with the Group Project (by December 12).\nThe Course Organiser/Tutors will moderate the self-assigned mark as part of a dialogue with you.\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Impression-based step-marking\nTo help you thinking about which mark to assign yourself, we will use an “impression-based step-marking” procedure. The procedure works as follows:\n\nFirst, think about the mark band you think you deserve.\nThen, choose a step within the band (see below for an explanation).\n\nOnce you pick a mark band, you need to pick a step within that band.

    "text": "2 Reflective Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nYou should post your self-reflection each week.\nYou should post your self-reflection by the Wednesday following the week the self-reflection is on. This is not a hard deadline and it is fine if you have to catch up with your self reflection in a later week. If we find that you have not posted in a couple of weeks we will get in touch.\nYou should write about 100-200 words for each self-reflection. This is not a hard target or limit. Sometimes you might need to write a bit more or a bit less, as long as you cover the important points. You are also given the space to write more than 200 words, but we might not be able to comment on everything extra to keep our work-load manageable.\n\n\n\nLearning is an active process: it happens best when we’re all engaged. Learning is also something that we can learn how to do better. Think of a hobby you might have or a skill you’ve learned: you’ve probably perfected it for a while, paying close attention to what did or didn’t work.\nThat’s why both students and the lecturer (Stefano) will reflect on how the course is going and what they’ve learned. After each class we’ll all write short self-reflections in the Reflective Journal. The tutors will comment on yours and you’ll be able to comment on mine.\nEach of us will have our own Reflective Journal on Learn. The tutors and I will be able to see your Reflective Journal, but you won’t be able to see other students’ Journals. My Journal (the lecturer’s) will be visible to all and you will also be able to comment on it.\nIn your self-reflection, you want to focus on your learning process: what did you learn, how easy or difficult was it, how did the learning affect your views on something? Here are more specific questions you can follow, but feel free to make adjustments. We recommend to lay out your the self-reflection based on the questions (see examples below) and to add a title to the self-reflection in the format “Week X” where “X” is the week number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-reflection questions\n\n\n\n\nParticipation and Engagement\nHow have I contributed to class activities and managed my independent study? Am I satisfied with my approach so far?\nLearning and Challenges\nWhich new topics did I encounter this week, how did I approach the weekly Challenge, and what difficulties—if any—did I face? How did I address them?\nImpact on Perspectives\nHow have this week’s lessons influenced my views on quantitative methods and related areas? Have my perspectives changed, been reinforced, or stayed the same?\nIntellectual Growth and Achievements\nIn what ways have I developed academically this week? What am I particularly proud of?\nExtra thoughts (optional; you can write as much as you like here, beyond the 100-200 words, but we might not be able to comment on everything to keep our work-load manageable).\n\n\n\nThe following boxes show three strong examples and three weak examples of self-reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong example 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1\nThis week, I actively participated in group problem-solving and contributed ideas in class discussions. My independent study was focused, though I wish I had dedicated more time to reviewing lecture notes before the Challenge. I encountered regression diagnostics for the first time and approached the Challenge by breaking it into smaller tasks. I struggled initially with interpreting residual plots but resolved this through peer discussion. The week’s content reinforced my appreciation for quantitative methods, especially in identifying model limitations. My main academic growth was in learning to critically evaluate statistical assumptions. I’m particularly proud of explaining a tricky concept to a peer, which clarified it for both of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong example 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1\nI’ve been consistently present in discussions, asking questions that push me beyond surface understanding. My self-study this week was more structured than before, using a mix of readings and practice exercises. Learning about different summary measures was new to me, and I tackled the Challenge by first reviewing the theory, then applying it to the dataset. Although I initially misunderstood one step, seeking clarification from the tutor helped. This reinforced my belief that statistical tools are most powerful when used critically. I’ve grown in my ability to connect concepts across topics, and I’m proud of having completed the Challenge which was very difficult for me. Next week, I aim to experiment with visualising results more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong example 3\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1\nIn class, I’ve been more reserved this week but contributed meaningfully during smaller group work. My self-directed study was less consistent than I’d like due to other commitments. The new topic was Bernoulli regressions, which I approached with online tutorials and textbook exercises before attempting the Challenge. I struggled with interpreting logit estimates but improved after re-reading lecture slides. This week slightly shifted my view of quantitative methods—I now see how easily results can be distorted if assumptions are ignored. My biggest intellectual gain was in developing a check-list for choosing models. While I’m proud of completing the Challenge despite time pressure, I’ll need to manage my schedule better to stay engaged in discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak example 1\n\n\n\n\n\nI did my work and took part in class. I learned some new things. The Challenge was okay and I finished it. My views on statistics are the same. I have grown a bit and I’m proud I completed my work.\nWhy it’s bad: No specifics, no examples, no reflection on challenges or growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak example 2\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation: I was in class. Independent study: I read. New topic: Regression. Challenge: I did it. Views: No change. Growth: Learned more stats. Pride: I finished on time.\nWhy it’s bad: Merely answers prompts without linking them or showing thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak example 3\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week I came to class and listened to the lecture. I joined in when people were talking, although I didn’t say a lot. I did some reading at home but not as much as I probably should have. We learned a new topic about statistics, which was interesting but also quite hard to follow. I did the Challenge activity and submitted it on time. It was a bit tricky but I figured it out eventually. My view on quantitative methods hasn’t really changed; I still think they are useful but complicated. I guess I’ve learned a bit more about how to use them, but it’s hard to say exactly what. I’m proud I got everything done, although I didn’t always understand it fully. I didn’t ask for help because I thought I could manage on my own.\nWhy it’s bad: Although it meets the word count, it stays vague, avoids specifics, and offers no meaningful insight into participation, learning, or challenges. It lists activities without explaining what was learned, how difficulties were addressed, or how the week’s work connects to personal growth. It also misses opportunities to show critical thinking or outline plans for improvement, making it more of a log than a self-reflection.\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Instructions for Weekly self-reflections submission\nAfter every class you’ll need to write one self-reflection in the Reflective Journal on Learn. Afterwards you need to read our feedback on your entries.\nWhat happens is:\n\nWe have class.\nWe reflect on our learning process.\nWe write down a self-reflection in one entry in the Reflective Journal on Learn.\nThe tutors comment on your reflections as soon as possible, and you might comment on mine.\nWe might also give general feedback in a collaborative discussion in class or via Learn announcements."

    "text": "3 Group Project and Final Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines\n\n\n\n\nYou must submit a Project Proposal to Turnitin by Thursday 6th November at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\nYou must submit your Final Reflection, including the product of your Group Project to Turnitin by Thursday 11th December at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Overview\nAs part of the assessment you will have to work on a Group Project. This project can be anything (some ideas below) so the structure of what you will have to submit differs depending on what you end up doing.\nIndependent of the type of project, you will have to write a Final Reflection where you propose and justify a mark for yourself based on your experience with the course and with working on you Group Project. Note that your mark suggestion is just a suggestion and the tutors and I will make the final decision. You should follow the marking rubric in Section 4.1 below. This reflection is what you submit to Turnitin on Learn by the deadline of Thursday 12th December. The reflection should contain the “product” of your Group Project, either as text following the reflection or as a link (since the Group Project can be any of different types of products).\nThe requisites for the Group Project are the following:\n\nIt has to be about linguistics, i.e. research on Language and/or languages.\nIt has to be on knowledge-oriented (aka “basic”) research, not on application-oriented (aka “applied”) research. Language/speech technology topics are not allowed.\nIt has to be in or on R and or Stan (used by R to run Bayesian regression models). Other programming languages are not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeas for Group Projects\n\n\n\n\nPick a linguistic question that interests you and run a mini quantitative study (this could well be a study where you also act as participants). Write a data analysis report.\nFind a linguistic topic and collect published effects from the relevant literature (the first step towards a fully-fledged meta-analysis). Curate the data set and make it available on the Open Science Framework and/or GitHub.\nConduct a meta-analysis of a topic in linguistics based on existing literature.\nDesign exercises and/or tutorials for the course using linguistic data.\nWrite a collection of sonnets on the replicability crisis.\nWrite an essay on a minoritised statistician.\nChoreograph an interpretative dance that illustrates how coefficients of a model of lexical decision task data are estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a regression model.\nRap a song about the history of statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that the project has to be on a “knowledge-oriented” topic, rather than on a application of statistics to practical problems or language processing/technology.\nSo for example the following project is fine: “Do participant respond faster when listening to synthetic speech generated by algorithm A vs those generated by algorithm B?” But the following projects will not be appropriate for the Group Project: “We want to write a speech-to-text algorithm in R” or “We will develop a natural language virtual assistant for online shopping” or “I will train a forced-aligner model for a new language”.\n\n\nAs explained above, you will have to submit a Final Reflection including the product or link to the product of the Group Project by by the deadline of Thursday 11th December at noon.\nFor any question about assessment, post your question on Piazza (unless it’s of a sensitive nature, then get in touch with Stefano).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nEach project will be different, so if you are unsure about how to approach your project idea or if you need help finding an idea in the first place, please get in touch with Stefano!\nStefano does not have telepathic powers (yet) and the only way for him to help you is for you to reach out. :)\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Instructions for Project proposal submission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadline\n\n\n\n\nYou must submit a Project Proposal to Turnitin by Thursday 6th November at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\n\n\n\n\nYou will have to submit a very short project proposal for approval by Thursday 6th November to Turnitin on Learn, but the earlier you submit the earlier you can start working on it! We will be checking submissions as they arrive and ask to get in touch if there are any issues.\nOnly one person per group should submit the proposal (there is no need for everyone in the group to submit the project proposal and you should just add all the names of the group members).\nA few sentences explaining the project will be sufficient. Note that this deadline is an informal deadline and there is no possibility of getting an extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf your project requires you to collect data from participants who are not students in this course, you will need to abide to a generic ethics approval sought by Stefano for this course. This means there will be limitations on which participants you can gather data from and which data you can collect from them. More information TBA.\n\n\nThe following boxes give you some examples of possible projects and project proposals, with an explanation on how you can go about completing these projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 1\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to replicate the study by Keogh, Kirby, and Culbertson (2024). The study use an artificial language learning paradigm to test the relationship between working memory and regularisation. We will run the exact same experiment with 5 participants and conduct the same analysis they did.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is a replication project. You will need to understand the original study design, make sure you have the same materials and protocols and you will have to recruit 5 participants (these can be students from the QML course, including yourselves). After data collection, you should analyse the data as in the original study and write a short report focussing on the analysis approach and results. Specifically, you should discuss how the new results compare with the ones from the original study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 2\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to collect recordings of ourselves reading a passage to illustrate different accents. We will include accents from: Scotland, England, India, Tanzania and Hungary. We will curate the data by formatting it so that it’s FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and we will make it available on the Open Science Framework with a CC-BY license. The data will be thoroughly documented.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is a data curation project. You will collect, format, organise and document data which you will make available online. This requires learning about file data management, file formats, Open Research practices and principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 3\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to draw an abstract paining that represents the analysis approach used in Hampton and Coretta (2024). The painting will be accompanied by a written piece with an explanation of the approach, our understanding and how this has shaped the painting.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is creative project. You will have to carefully read the paper, understand the analysis, which will likely be of a more advanced level compared to what you have learnt so far, and use your creativity to create a painting (no need to be artists to make a painting!). The written piece will have to show that you have understood and internalised the analysis and that this understanding has driven the production of the painting. What you submit is the written piece and high resolution photo of the painting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 4\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe are interested in the relationship between vowel height and vowel duration in Hungarian. We will run a small-scale study with recordings from 2 or 3 speakers of Hungarian. We will analyse the vowel duration using Bayesian regression models.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is research project. You will have to think of a research question/hypothesis (they do not have to be novel and you can reuse existing questions/hypotheses) and collect and analyse data. Note that we are restricted by a generic ethics approval (see above, more information TBA). The written report will have to focus on the data collection and analysis (you should put less focus on literature review and discussion).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample project 5\n\n\n\n\n\nProject proposal\n\nWe want to re-analyse the data from Ota (2013). The original study used frequentist regression models, but we will instead apply a Bayesian regression model.\n\nHow to complete it\nThis is robustness assessment project. You will have to get hold of the original data and re-analyse it using a different approach than that in the original study. The report will describe the original approach and your approach, report the results and assess how these are different (if at all) from the original study’s results.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Instructions for Group Project and Final Reflection submission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadline\n\n\n\n\nYou must submit your Final Reflection, including the product of your Group Project, to Turnitin by Thursday 11th December at noon on Learn &gt; Assessment.\nNormal extensions are not possible, so carefully plan your time accordingly. Learning Adjustments extensions and Special Circumstances applications are possible. Note that Learning Adjustments extensions do not extend to group-mates who don’t have Learning Adjustments in place.\n\n\n\n\nYou should submit a PDF file.\nYou should use this Quarto document template (right-click and download). For the submission, please render the Quarto file to PDF (I suggest trying this as soon as you download the file, to ensure you have all the necessary software for rendering to PDF).\nEvery student should submit. Your submission should include the same Group Project output or link to it (we will discard the similarity ratings on Turnitin).\nIn your submission, include the Group Project title and the NAMES of the members of the group (not the student number nor the exam number), including yourself, as per the template linked above.\nIf you are unsure about anything, please post a question on Piazza."

In the workshop you will further practice your R skills with group data challenges (with the exception of the workshop of week 1, where you will go through the R basics chapters in the textbook in class).\nThe Schedule overview below gives you an overview of each week, while the Weekly schedule is a more in-depth description of the activities and materials of each week."

The main goal of the New Statistics is to shift the attention from statistical significance to estimation with quantification of uncertainty."

Feel free to work on the others as well if you have time.\nIf you are unsure about anything, please ask us for directions!\nThe tasks are designed for you to practice this week’s R skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask A: Italian Voice Onset Time\n\n\n\n\nRead the coretta2018a/ita_egg.rds data.\nSummarise relevant columns, with a particular focus on how VOT (voice onset time, column vot) differs depending on phonological features like place, voicing, vowel and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask B: World Atlas of Language Structures\n\n\n\n\nThe data from WALS are available through the R package ritwals.\nInstall the package. Then attach it and load the data with data(\"WALS\").\nGet the number of languages by features (feature_ID and feature_name) you are interested in. The features are listed here.\nCheck the counts of “Systems of Gender Assignment” and “Order of Object and Verb” alone and together. Can you spot a preference for certain combinations of the two?\nCheck other feature combinations that make linguistic sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask C: Massive Auditory Lexical Decision\n\n\n\n\nRead the tucker2019/mald_1_1.rds data.\nSummarise the data with number of participants, number of words, number of words by lexical status (real vs nonce word, IsWord), reaction times by lexical status, reaction times by lexical status and accuracy, accuracy by lexical status.\nWhat can you tell about reaction times and accuracy based on lexical status? What about individual variation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\nFor feedback, ask us in class and/or send your work to Stefano and/or come to Stefano’s office hours (you can also come in groups).\nWe will not provide you with model answers, so make sure you make the most of us in person."
