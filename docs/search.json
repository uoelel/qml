    "text": "2 R packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you have previously installed the C++ toolkit, CmdStan and/or cmdstanr, or if you have recently updated your OS, please follow these instructions to reinstall them.\n\n\nNow you will need to install a few packages and extra software.\nHere is an overview of what you will install:\n\nC++ toolchain.\nR packages: tidyverse, remotes, cmdstanr, brms.\nCmdStan (including Stan).\n\n\n2.1 Install the C++ toolchain\nSome of the software (CmdStan) used in the workshops require a working C++ toolchain for compilation.\nYou can find information on how to set up the C++ toolchain in Section 1.2.1 of the CmdStan User’s Guide.\nMake sure to follow the instructions for your operating system.\n\n\n2.2 Install the R packages\nAfter you have installed the C++ toolchain, you need to install the following R packages. Run the following in the Console.\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"stan-dev/cmdstanr\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"brms\"))\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidybayes\", \"extraDistr\"))\nThe cmdstanr package is an interface between R and CmdStan (see below), while brms is the package you will use to run Bayesian linear models (think of it as the Bayesian equivalent of lme4).\nIt will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.\nIf at any point you get asked about installing extra packages or software or update existing packages or software, please do so. In all cases, carefully read the message in the Console or in a pop-up window: they always tell you what to do or the options you have.\n\n\n2.3 Install CmdStan\nNow that you have installed the R packages, you need to install CmdStan.\nCmdStan is a shell interface to the programming language Stan.\nStan is what runs the Bayesian models, but you don’t have to know Stan, because you will use the R packages to run the models (those packages will communicate with Stan in your stead).\nTo install CmdStan, run the following command in the R console:\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = parallel::detectCores(), overwrite = TRUE)\nIt will take several minutes and you will see a lot of text flashing in the Console.\n\n\n2.4 Check your installation\nRun the following in the RStudio Console.\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nfile &lt;- file.path(cmdstan_path(), \"examples\", \"bernoulli\", \"bernoulli.stan\")\nmod &lt;- cmdstan_model(file, force_recompile = TRUE)\ndata_list &lt;- list(N = 10, y = c(0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1))\nfit &lt;- mod$sample(\n  data = data_list, \n  seed = 123, \n  chains = 4, \n  parallel_chains = 4,\n  refresh = 500 # print update every 500 iters\n)\nIf everything goes well you should see Compiling Stan program… and then Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains… followed by information on chains and iterations."

    "text": "Welcome to the main site of the course Quantitative Methods for Linguistics and English Language (Semester 1).\nThis website is your go-to place throughout the semester for any info related to the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse description\n\n\n\nThis course is an introduction to quantitative data analysis (including data wrangling, visualisation and modelling) as commonly employed in linguistics, using the R software.\nWe will cover the following topics:\n\nThe basics of quantitative data analysis.\nData preparation.\nData summaries.\nPrinciples of data visualisation.\nStatistical modelling with linear models.\nStatistical inference using Bayesian inference (posterior probability distributions and credible intervals) and frequentist inference (p-values and confidence intervals).\n\nAt completion of the course you will have gained the following skills:\n\nImport common data formats, tidy and transform data.\nChoosing and reporting appropriate summary measures.\nUsing compelling visualisations to communicate a specific message about patterns in the data.\nMaster linear models for different types of data (continuous measures and binary outcomes).\nUsing Bayesian inference to answer research questions and avoid common interpretation pitfalls of frequentist techniques.\n\nExamples from different branches of linguistics will be used to provide you with hands-on experience in quantitative data analysis and Open Research practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse rationale\n\n\n\nThis course is designed to help you develop the necessary skills for conducting and interpreting analyses of data as commonly employed in linguistics.\nThe content and objectives of the course are in response to recent advances in our understanding of the theory behind research methods.\nRecent meta-scientific research has identified three important aspects of research: the reproducibility, replicability and generalisability.\n\nA result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.\nA result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.\nA result is generalisable when a different analysis workflow performed on different data sets produces qualitatively similar answers.\n\nSee Definitions for a more detailed explanation.\nHowever, based on surveys from different disciplines, we are currently facing the three research crises (reproducibility, replicability and generalisability crises) by which most results are neither reproducible, nor replicable, nor generalisable (Munafò et al. 2017, Simmons et al. 2011, Ioannidis 2005, Yarkoni 2022).\nThe Open Research movement (also known as Open Science or Open Scholarship, Crüwell et al. 2019) was developed with the aim of improving our understanding of these crises and with the objective of providing researchers with guidelines and tools to produce reproducible, replicable and generalisable research.\nThe statistical philosophy adopted in the course is that of the New Statistics (Cumming 2014, Kruschke and Liddell 2018. The main goal of the New Statistics is to shift the attention from statistical significance to estimation with quantification of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for help\n\n\n\nIf at any point during the course you don’t feel comfortable with any aspect of the course, you are unsure about anything that has been covered in class or in your own time, you are struggling to keep up with the course workload, you are experiencing mental of physical distress due to a pre-existing or new illness, medical condition or disability, or you find yourself unable to access basic needs like food or housing, please do get in touch with me and/or the PPLS support (go to the PPLS UG or MSc Hub on SharePoint &gt; Support for students &gt; Health & Wellbeing).\nWe are humans first and the rapidly-changing new world we are living in now can put us under pressure. What is most important to me is that you are first and foremost healthy and able to participate to the course, and that you succeed and get the most out of the course.\nIt is OK not to be OK, and remember that you are not alone. Other people, teachers and students, might be struggling right now or have struggled before and might have gone through what you are going through now. Remember that support exists for you, so please do reach out. If you see somebody close to you struggling, please let them know about the available support network and encourage them to reach out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\n\nYou can reach me (Stefano) at s.coretta@ed.ac.uk or on Teams.\nIf you want to book office hours with me or the tutors, you can do so here: https://bit.ly/33BH84L. Location depends on whom you are seeing and which day, so check the confirmation email for that info!"

I like to call the discipline that deals with research methods Hodotics.\nOne way of categorising different aspects of research methods is represented in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can think of research methods as the combination of:\n\nThe research process: the process of conducting a research project, from determining the research context to communicating results.\nProject management: the process of managing a research project, from project planning to writing-up.\nDigital skills: all research involves using computers (at least at some point if not throughout) so that computer literacy and digital skills are nowadays a fundamental aspect of research.\nPhilosophy: all research is not performed in a vacuum and a lot of philosophical questions shape the entire research process.\nEthics: all research is not performed in a social vacuum and ethical considerations are a fundamental aspect of research."
