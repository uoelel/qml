## Instructions

-   Pick one of the following tasks and work through it in group.

-   If you are unsure about anything, please ask us for directions!

-   The tasks are designed for you to practice Bayesian Gaussian modelling.

## Task A: Mixean Basque Voice Onset Time

-   Read the `egurtzegi2020/eu_vot.csv` data.

-   Filter the data to include only aspirated consonants.

-   Answer the following question using a Gaussian model: what is the mean and SD of aspirated VOT in Mixean Basque?

## Task B: Shallow morphological parsing (RT)

-   Read the `song2020/shallow.csv` data. Familiarise yourself with the study (<https://uoelel.github.io/qml-data/data/song2020/shallow.html>).

-   Filter the data to include only L2 data from critical trials.

-   Answer the following question using a Gaussian model: what is the mean and SD of reaction times in L2 participants?

## Task C: Reading fixation times (eye-tracking)

-   Read `berzak2025/fix-dur.csv` and familiarise yourself with the study and [data documentation](https://uoelel.github.io/qml-data/data/berzak2025/fix-dur.html).

-   Answer the following question using a Gaussian model: what is the mean and SD of fixation durations in the data set?

-   Now run another model but with only 5 participants (sample 5 random participants from the data set). What happens to the posterior distributions of the mean and SD?

## Feedback

For feedback, ask us in class and/or send your work to Stefano and/or come to Stefano's office hours (you can also come in groups).

**We will not provide you with model answers**, so make sure you make the most of us in person.
