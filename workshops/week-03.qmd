## Task A: Albanian Voice Onset Time

-   Read the `coretta2021/alb-vot.csv` data.

-   Calculate the VOT based on the `release` and `voice_onset` columns. (VOT is the time lag between the voicing onset and the consonant release).

-   Create a new column that specifies the voicing of the consonant (voiced or voiceless) based on the value in `label`. `ifelse()` or `case_when()` are useful.

-   Get summary measures of VOT for voiceless and voiced consonants. Can the VOT differentiate between the two voicing categories?

## Task B: Albanian vowels

-   Read the `coretta2021/alb_formants.rds` data.

-   Create a scatter plot of F1 and F2, with points coloured by `vowel`. Are the vowels in the places you'd expect them to be?

-   Now create another scatter plot with F1 and vowel duration. You need to calculate vowel duration first from `start` and `end`. Can you notice any patterns in the relationship between F1 and vowel duration?

## Task C: **'Everywhere here can say this'**

-   Read the `slukin2022/everywhere-loc.csv` data. The data are acceptability judgements on the impersonal use of "everywhere", like in the sentence "Everywhere here can say this".

-   The `Restrictor` column tells you if the sentence has a restrictor, like in "Everywhere *on the coast* eats fish and chips." vs no restrictor "Everywhere takes credit cards these days." The `Value` column gives you the acceptability rating from 1 to 7.

-   Mutate the `Restrictor` column so that 0 = "no restrictor" and 1 = "restrictor".

-   Mutate the `Value` column so that it is a character column (use `as.character()`).

-   Create a filled stacked bar chart by `Restrictor` with fill by `Value` and panels by `Age`. Can you spot differences in rating across different age brackets?
