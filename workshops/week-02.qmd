## Instructions

-   Pick one of the following tasks and work on them in group. Feel free to work on the others as well if you have time.

-   If you are unsure about anything, please ask us for directions!

-   The tasks are designed for you to practice this week's R skills.

-   Unless otherwise specified, the data are part of the data archive you downloaded for [Read Data](https://stefanocoretta.github.io/qdal/ch-read-data.html) chapter of the textbook. Information about the data can be found on the [QML Data](https://uoelel.github.io/qml-data/) website (which is also where you downloaded the data from).

## Task A: Italian Voice Onset Time

-   Read the `coretta2018a/ita_egg.rds` data.

-   Summarise relevant columns, with a particular focus on how VOT (voice onset time, column `vot`) differs depending on phonological features like place, voicing, vowel and so on.

## Task B: World Atlas of Language Structures

-   The data from [WALS](https://wals.info) are available through the R package [ritwals](https://hkauhanen.fi/ritwals/index.html).

-   Install the package. Then attach it and load the data with `data("WALS")`.

-   Get the number of languages by features (`feature_ID` and `feature_name`) you are interested in. The features are listed [here](https://wals.info/feature).

-   Check the counts of "Systems of Gender Assignment" and "Order of Object and Verb" alone and together. Can you spot a preference for certain combinations of the two?

-   Check other feature combinations that make linguistic sense.

## Task C: Massive Auditory Lexical Decision

-   Read the `tucker2019/mald_1_1.rds` data.

-   Summarise the data with number of participants, number of words, number of words by lexical status (real vs nonce word, `IsWord`), reaction times by lexical status, reaction times by lexical status and accuracy, accuracy by lexical status.

-   What can you tell about reaction times and accuracy based on lexical status? What about individual variation?
