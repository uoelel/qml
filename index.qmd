Welcome to the main site of the course *Quantitative Methods for Linguistics and English Language* (Semester 1).

This website is your go-to place throughout the semester for any info related to the course.

## Course description

This course is an introduction to **quantitative data analysis** (including data wrangling, visualisation and modelling) as commonly employed in linguistics, using the R software.

We will cover the following **topics**:

-   The basics of quantitative data analysis.
-   Data preparation.
-   Data summaries.
-   Principles of **data visualisation**.
-   Statistical modelling with **linear models**.
-   Statistical inference using **Bayesian inference** (posterior probability distributions and credible intervals) and frequentist inference (*p*-values and confidence intervals).

At completion of the course you will have gained the following **skills**:

-   Import common data formats, tidy and transform data.
-   Choosing and reporting appropriate summary measures.
-   Using compelling visualisations to communicate a specific message about patterns in the data.
-   Master linear models for different types of data (continuous measures and binary outcomes).
-   Using Bayesian inference to answer research questions and avoid common interpretation pitfalls of frequentist techniques.

Examples from different branches of linguistics will be used to provide you with hands-on experience in quantitative data analysis and Open Research practices.
