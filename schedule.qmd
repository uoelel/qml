## Schedule overview

The course is structured in a "choose your own adventure" format, so there isn't a set content for each week.

However, the seminars will have a different major theme each week, which you will have to research and discuss in groups in class.

The following tables gives you an approximate schedule of the weekly themes, although they are subject to change also in light of your preferences.

| Week | Seminar                                                          | Lab |

| 1    | More than numbers: quantitative methods and uncertainty          |     |
| 2    | The research process: research ethics and questionable practices |     |
| 3    | Language endangerment and small numbers                          |     |
