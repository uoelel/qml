## Choose your own adventure

The course is structured in a "**choose your own adventure**" format, so there isn't a set content for each week.

::: callout-important
**Each week**, you will attend two classes:

-   A **one-hour seminar**.

-   A **two-hour lab**.

Note that you are *divided in two groups*, so that the seminar and lab run twice each week, you just need to attend one of the seminars and one of the labs each week.
:::

The **seminars** will have a different major theme each week, which you will have to research before class and discuss in groups in class.

**You are also expected to learn quantitative methods outside of class**, at your own time (as in a flipped classroom). This website has a list of entries in the Adventurer's [Notebook](notebook.qmd). You are not restricted to those posts, and you can learn from other resources, however if this is the very first time you are learning quantitative methods I recommend you stick to those since they have been curated for beginners. You can find a map of how the different posts build on each other in the Adventurer's [Map](map.qmd).

The **labs** will create the opportunity for you to practice quantitative data analysis with R. Each week you will pick a "challenge" from a list or come up with your own challenge and work towards solving it using R. More details will be shared soon.

As part of the [Assessments](assessments.qmd), you will have to complete a **group project**. You can start working on the project any time during the course, but the last two labs will be dedicated to working on your project while being able to get help from the instructor (Stefano) and the Tutors.

## Schedule overview

The following tables gives you an approximate schedule of the weekly themes, although they are subject to change also in light of your preferences. Check the week-by-week boxes below for a more detailed description of what you should be doing each week.

## Recommended textbooks

There isn't a required course textbook as such, but the majority of the course content are covered in the following textbooks:

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) \[R4DS\]. This is an introduction to R.

-   [Statistical (Re)thinking](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/permalink/44UOE_INST/110jsec/alma9924745740602466). This is a textbook that teaches statistics in R with a focus on Bayesian regression modelling. It is meant for beginners but intermediate and advanced users can benefit from the later chapters.

-   [Statistics for Linguists](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/permalink/44UOE_INST/7g3mt6/alma9924344853202466). This is a textbook that teaches statistics in R with a focus on frequentist regression modelling. It is meant for beginners but intermediate and advanced users can benefit from the later chapters.
