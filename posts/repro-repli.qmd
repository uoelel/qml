## Definitions

The terms *reproducible* and *replicable* are often used interchangeably but The Turning Way has proposed a semantic scheme which introduces two more terms: *robust* and *generalisable*.

Check out the section [Table of Definitions for Reproducibility](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#table-of-definitions-for-reproducibility) from [The Turing Way book](https://book.the-turing-way.org), which defines the four terms.
