## Research methods

[Research Methods]{.smallcaps} are about the theory, methods and practice of conducting research. I like to call the discipline that deals with research methods [Hodotics]{.smallcaps}.

One way of categorising different aspects of research methods is represented in the following figure.

You can think of **research methods** as the combination of:

-   The **research process**: the process of conducting a research project, from determining the research context to communicating results.

-   **Project management**: the process of managing a research project, from project planning to writing-up.

-   **Digital skills**: all research involves using computers (at least at some point if not throughout) so that computer literacy and digital skills are nowadays a fundamental aspect of research.

-   **Philosophy**: all research is not performed in a vacuum and a lot of philosophical questions shape the entire research process.

-   **Ethics**: all research is not performed in a social vacuum and ethical considerations are a fundamental aspect of research.
