## What is statistics?

Statistics is a **tool**. But what does it do? There are at least four ways of looking at statistics as a tool.

-   Statistics is the **science** concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. (From [UCI Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.uci.edu/what-is-statistics/))

-   Statistics is the **technology** of extracting information, illumination and understanding from data, often in the face of uncertainty. (From the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/blog/what-is-statistics/))

-   Statistics is a **mathematical and conceptual** discipline that focuses on the relation between data and hypotheses. (From the [Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/))

-   Statistics as the **art** of applying the science of scientific methods. (From [ORI Results](https://www.oriresults.com/articles/blog-posts/the-art-of-statistics/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00898-0))

To quote a statistician:

::: callout-note
*Statistic is both a science and an art*.

It is a *science* in that its methods are basically systematic and have general application and an *art* in that their successful application depends, to a considerable degree, on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application.

—L. H. C. Tippett

## What statistics is NOT

Statistics is a lot of things, but it is also *not* a lot of things.

-   Statistics is **not maths**, but it is informed by maths.

-   Statistics is **not about hard truths** not how to seek the truth (see [Inference and uncertainty](inference.qmd)).

-   Statistics is **not a purely objective** endeavour. In fact there are a *lot* of subjective aspects to statistics (see below).

-   Statistics is **not a substitute** of common sense and expert knowledge.

-   Statistics is **not just** about $p$-values and significance testing.

As Gollum would put it, *all that glisters is not gold*.

## Many Analysts, One Data Set: subjectivity exposed

![](../img/red-card.jpg){fig-align="center" width="250"}

In [Silberzahn et al 2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747646), a group of researchers asked 29 independent analysis teams to answer the following question based on provided data: **Is there a link between player skin tone and number of red cards in soccer?**

Crucially,

-   **69%** of the teams reported an effect of player skin tone, and **31%** did not.

-   In total, the 29 teams came up with **21 unique** types of statistical analysis.

These results clearly show how subjective statistics is and how even a straightforward question can lead to a multitude of answers.

To put it in Silberzah et al's words:

> The observed results from analyzing a complex data set can be highly contingent on **justifiable**, but **subjective**, analytic decisions.

This is why you should always be somewhat **sceptical of the results of any single study**: you never know what results might have been found if another research team did the study. This is a reason for why replicating research is very important.

[Coretta et al 2023](https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459231162567) tried something similar, but in the context of the speech sciences: they asked 30 independent analysis teams (84 signed up, 46 submitted an analysis, 30 submitted usable analyses) to answer the question **Do speakers acoustically modify utterances to signal atypical word combinations?**

Incredibly, the 30 teams submitted:

-   **109** individual analyses. A bit more than 3 analyses per team!
-   **52** unique measurement specifications and **47** unique model specifications.

> Nine teams out of the thirty (30%) reported to have found at least one statistically reliable effect (based on the inferential criteria they specified). Of the 170 critical model coefficients, 37 were claimed to show a statistically reliable effect (21.8%).

## The "New Statistics"

The Silberzahn et al and Coretta et al studies are just the tip of the iceberg. We are currently facing a "research crisis".

<!-- Add link to research crises -->

[Cumming 2014](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797613504966) proposes a new approach to statistics, which he calls the "New Statistics", in response to the research crisis. 

The New Statistics mainly addresses **three problems**:

-   Published research is a biased selection of all (existing and possible) research.

-   Data analysis and reporting are often selective and biased.

-   In many research fields, studies are rarely replicated, so false conclusions persist.

To help solve those problems, it proposes **these solutions** (among others):

-   Promoting **research integrity**.

-   Shifting away from statistical significance to **estimation**.

-   Building a **cumulative** quantitative discipline.

## The Bayesian New Statistics

[Kurschke and Liddell 2018](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1221-4) revisit the New Statistics and make a further proposal: to adopt the historically older but only recently popularised approach of Bayesian statistics. They call this the Bayesian New Statistics.

The classical approach to statistics is the **frequentist method**, based on work by Fisher, and Neyman and Pearson. Frequentist statistics is based on rejecting the "null hypothesis" (i.e. the hypothesis that there is no difference between groups) using *p*-values.

**Bayesian statistics** provides researchers with more appropriate and more robust ways to answer research questions, by reallocation of belief/credibility across possibilities.

You can learn more about the frequentist and the Bayesian approach [here](freq-bayes.qmd).
