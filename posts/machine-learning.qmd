## Machine Learning

**Machine Learning** is an approach to learning from data using a variety of statistical tools. These are the same tools that you would use in the context of a research study, but their are used with the aim of creating statistical models that can automatise processes and task.

Machine Learning is possibly the most applied approach to quantitative methods and statistics.

If you are interested in focussing on Machine Learning, I can recommend either of the following books:

-   [Hands-on Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/).

-   [Introduction to Machine Learning with R](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/permalink/44UOE_INST/7g3mt6/alma9925334736002466).
