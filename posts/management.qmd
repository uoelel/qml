Managing a research project, whether it's a solo project like a dissertation or it's a large-scale project with many people, involves a lot of project management skills.

The three most important aspects of research project managements are:

-   **Project planning**: anything related to planning and executing your research project, including managing other team members.

-   **Research management**: managing references, papers, research notes and more.

-   **File management**: probably the most neglected aspect of research project management, managing your files, from collected data to images to written work.
