Some disciplines use Bayesian probability theory to create linguistic models that explain specific types of linguistic processing. Despite this being "Bayesian" it is very different from using Bayesian regression models. An example of a paper that approaches linguistic processing using Bayesian theory is [Sociolinguistic interaction and identity construction: The view from game-theoretic pragmatic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12229?casa_token=2mVHg23dxzgAAAAA%3AiDwPISV17OTOMKUEEQTyCbwDqng_5W--ASNJVBQN0Z0IaxxUCLsNN-o1qvJa0XDYmE-sPeRq_tavmg), but there are many others.
