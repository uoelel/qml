## Sample $y$

]

When we ask a research question, we collect a sample $y$ from a population.

---

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
$y$ is a sample of values (`\(y_1, y_2, y_3, ..., y_n\)`).
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
Sample of values can be e.g.:

- Number of telic and atelic verbs in a historical corpus of Sanskrit.

- Voice Onset Time of stops from 50 speakers Mapudungun.

- Friendliness ratings of synthetic speech as indicated by 300 participants.

**A (statistical) variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted**

- When you observe or measure something, you are taking note of the values generated by the variable.

- It's called variable because it varies (ha!).

- The opposite of a variable is a *constant*.

**Numeric continuous variable**: *between any two values there is an infinite number of values*.

- The variable can take on any positive and negative number, including 0.

- The variable can take on any positive number only.

- **Proportions** and **percentages**: The variable can take on any number between 0 and 1.
]

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--purple.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt1[
**Numeric discrete variable**: *between any two consecutive values there are no other values*.

- **Counts**: The variable can take only on any positive integer number.
]

--

.bg-washed-yellow.b--gold.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt1[
**Categorical (discrete) variable**.

- **Binary** or **dichotomous**: The variable can take only one of two values.

- The variable can take any of three of more values.

- **Ordinal**: The variable can take any of three of more values and the values have a natural order.

# Operationalisation

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
We can **operationalise** something as a numeric or a categorical variable.

- Voice Onset Time.

- Friendliness of speech.

# Summary measures

.center[

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
We can summarise variables using **summary measures**.
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

There are two types of summary measures.

**Measures of central tendency**

- Measures of central tendency indicate the **typical or central value** of a sample. 

**Measures of dispersion**

- Measures of dispersion indicate the **spread or dispersion** of the sample values around the central tendency value.
]

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Always report a measure of central tendency together with a measure of dispersion!**

# Measures of central tendency

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Mean**

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} = \frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n}$$
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Median**

$$\text{if } n \text{ is odd, } x_\frac{n+1}{2}$$

$$\text{if } n \text{ is even,  } \frac{x_\frac{n}{2} + x_\frac{n}{2}}{2}$$

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Mode**

]

---

# Measures of dispersion

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Range**

$$ max(x) - min(x)$$

The difference between the largest and smallest value.

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**Standard deviation**

$$\text{SD} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n+1}} = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + ... + (x_n - \bar{x})^2}{n+1}}$$
]


---

# Mean

Use the mean with **numeric continuous variables**, if:

- The variable can take on any positive and negative number, including 0.

```{r mean-1}
mean(c(-1.12, 0.95, 0.41, -2.1, 0.09))
```

- The variable can take on any positive number only.

```{r mean-2}
mean(c(0.32, 2.58, 1.5, 0.12, 1.09))

# Median

---

Use the median with **numeric continuous and discrete variables**.

```{r median-1}
median(c(-1.12, 0.95, 0.41, -2.1, 0.09))
sort(c(-1.12, 0.95, 0.41, -2.1, 0.09))
median(c(0.32, 2.58, 1.5, 0.12, 1.09))
sort(c(0.32, 2.58, 1.5, 0.12, 1.09))
```

---

```{r median-2}
median(c(4, 6, 3, 9, 7, 15))
sort(c(4, 6, 3, 9, 7, 15))
```

---

```{r median-3}
median(c(4, 6, 3, 9, 7, 15))
mean(c(4, 6, 3, 9, 7, 15))
median(c(4, 6, 3, 9, 7, 40))
mean(c(4, 6, 3, 9, 7, 40))

.bg-washed-yellow.b--gold.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt1[
- **The mean is very sensitive to outliers.**

- The median is **not**.
]

---

layout: false

# Mode

Use the mode with **categorical discrete variables**.

```{r mode}
table(c("red", "red", "blue", "yellow", "blue", "green", "red", "yellow"))
```

The mode is the most frequent value: `red`.

--

.bg-washed-yellow.b--gold.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt1[
**Likert scales are ordinal (categorical) variables, so the mean and median are not appropriate!**
]

---

# Range

Use the range with any **numeric variable**.

```{r range}
x_1 <- c(-1.12, 0.95, 0.41, -2.1, 0.09)
max(x_1) - min(x_1)

x_2 <- c(0.32, 2.58, 1.5, 0.12, 1.09)
max(x_2) - min(x_2)

x_3 <- c(4, 6, 3, 9, 7, 15)
max(x_3) - min(x_3)
```

---

# Standard deviation

Use the standard deviation with **numeric continuous variables**, if:

- The variable can take on any positive and negative number, including 0.

```{r sd-1}
sd(c(-1.12, 0.95, 0.41, -2.1, 0.09))
```

- The variable can take on any positive number only.

```{r sd-2}
sd(c(0.32, 2.58, 1.5, 0.12, 1.09))
```

--

.bg-washed-yellow.b--gold.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt1[
**Don't use the standard deviation with proportions and percentages!**

Standard deviations are **relative** and depend on the measurement **unit/scale!**

- The **sample** $y$ is generated by a (random) variable $Y$.

- A (statistical) **variable** is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted.

- Variables can be **numeric or categorical**.

  - Numeric variables can be continuous or discrete.
  - Categorical variables are only discrete.
  
- We **operationalise** a measure/observation as a numeric or a categorical variable.

- We summarise variables using **summary measures**:

  - Measures of **central tendency** indicate the typical or central value of a sample.
  - Measures of **dispersion indicate** the spread or dispersion of the sample values around the central tendency value.
