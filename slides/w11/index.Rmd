## Why do we do statistical analysis?

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

**To answer the questions:**

- Is there a difference between groups?

- How big is that difference?

- Does the difference accord with our theory?

]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

There are two major schools of statistical analysis in use today: **Bayesian** and **frequentist**.

## Differences between Bayesian and frequentist statistics

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

**Bayesian:**

- Aim: Quantify uncertainty (e.g., "How certain are we that an effect is positive?").
- All parameters in a model are thought of as probability distributions.

]

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

**Frequentist:**

- Aim: Reject the null hypothesis (often written as H0).
- Parameters in a model are just the single number that the model considers most likely.

]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

**In the linguistics literature, frequentist analyses are by far the most common.**

This week walks through how they work.

**Summary statistics** are measures whose purpose is to **summarise.**

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
Similarly, **test statistics** are measures whose purpose is to **test**.

The test statistic that frequentist linear models use is the **Student's t-statistic**, also known as the **t-value.**
]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
Why the t-value?

1. It is a **standardised measure of the difference** between two means.
2. We know which t-values are **common vs. rare in the world of the null hypothesis**.

Important so that we can **compare** the t-value for our data to the plausible t-values in that world.
]

???

A difference on a standardised scale.
A scale of km is very different than a scale of mm, so a t-value is a useful way of abstracting away from the original scales and talking about differences between means in a standardised way.

## Recap: The frequentist reasoning process

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

**(1)** We assume we live in a world in which there truly is no difference between groups (i.e., no effect).
  - In other words, the null hypothesis that there is no difference (aka the H0) is true.

]

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

**(2)** We fit a linear model to our data. For every parameter in the model, we get a t-value.

]

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

**(3)** The t-value is compared to the distribution of all t-values under H0. 
  - If it is in the 2.5% in each tail, then p < 0.05. **We can reject the null hypothesis!**
  - If it is *not* in the 2.5% in each tail, then p > 0.05. **We cannot reject the null hypothesis.**

]

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
These are the only two possible outcomes of a frequentist analysis.
- **It is never possible to *accept* the null hypothesis.** 
- **It is never possible to *accept* the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference.**
]

???

Is this telling us anything that we actually want to know?
This method doesn't allow us to say anything about our actual hypothesis of interest.

(Pause here and take questions.)

## What can make a p-value small?

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

- The p-value depends on the **t-value.**

--

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[

The bigger the dataset, the smaller the p-value.

> We fitted a frequentist linear model with a Gaussian distribution that predicted logged reaction times as a function of trial number. This predictor was centred.

> According to the model, the logged reaction time halfway through the experiment was 7.03 (95% CI: [7.01, 7.05]).
Moving forward one trial decreases logged reaction time by 0.02 (95% CI: [â€“0.023, â€“0.016], p < 0.001).

> We therefore reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between trial index and logged reaction times; the increase in speed is statistically significant.

## The formula for Student's t

<br>

$$t = \frac{\mu_b - \mu_a}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_a}{n_a} + \frac{\sigma^2_b}{n_b}}} = \frac{\text{diff. between means}}{\text{standard error of diff. between means}}$$

where:

- $\mu_a$ and $\mu_b$ are the means of Groups A and B

- $\sigma^2_a$ and $\sigma^2_b$ are the squared standard deviations (i.e., the variances) of Groups A and B

- $n_a$ and $n_b$ are the sample sizes of Groups A and B
