title: "Language endangerement and small numbers"

In Week 2 we discussed about research methods, quantitative methods and uncertainty. A common theme that emerges in that discussion is that of how much data we have, usually referred to as the size of the [sample](../posts/inference.qmd) or sample size.

A big concern in linguistics is the practical challenge of getting a sample that is big enough for languages that are spoken by minoritised communities and/or that are endangered (often the two things go together). Can we still do quantitative research in these contexts?

#### Prompts

- What can we do to improve the representation of minoritised languages in quantitative research?

- Can we still do quantitative research with languages spoken by 5-10 people?

- Why is there so much research on English?

- What are the best practices for engaging with language communities in a way that respects their knowledge and autonomy?
